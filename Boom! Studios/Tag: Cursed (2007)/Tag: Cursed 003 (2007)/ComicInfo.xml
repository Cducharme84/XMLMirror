  <Series>Tag: Cursed</Series>
  <Summary>Ed continues to follow the trail of people who have been "tagged".  He finds a surfer named Cody who had been tagged and had turned into a sort of messiah for people to worship.  Cody tries to kill Ed because he saw in a dream that Ed was trying to destroy what he had built.  Ed runs away and continues through the trail to Elizabeth Porter, who seems to fall in love with him.  Ed stayed with her awhile until she almost killed him, thinking he was the person she originally tagged that had abused her.  She was put in a mental institution and once again Ed was left completely alone.</Summary>
