  <Summary>Web of Evil: A young gay man is brutally murdered in a swamp by sadistic Billy Rivers. Meanwhile, Miz Liza "reads the bones" to Miss Brown and believes a "Mojo" (voodoo priest) is in town.

Mojo Man: Coley arrives in Palmettoville, and is eyed suspiciously by Chief Beasley, who suggests he can get a room at Palmetto House, but advises he leave town quickly. Coley interrupts Billy beating up Joey. Joey tells Coley about his friend's murder. At Palmetto House, Carolina is quickly smitten with Coley, and moves him into her room. He tells her he's looking for a "gang of killers". Beasley, who realizes Coley is a lot nicer than he seems, discusses the murders with him. Rich girl Samantha Bishop invites Coley to perform at her mansion; both she and her friend Douglas O'Hara are attracted to him. Miz Liza, protective of Carolina, shows her how wild and uncontrollable Coley is, then offers him the formula for the voodoo sex potion-- something no "Mojo" has ever had before-- if he'll just leave her alone. Coley does, and shacks up with Joey instead. In a bad part of town, Maggie O'Hara has her way with Coley, then tells him she has videotape evidence of one of the killings. He urges her to take it to the police before anything else happens. Kit arrives in town, introducing herself to Carolina. On his way to church, Joey is kidnapped by Billy.
