  <Summary>Blood in the Sky: On the deck of the sailing ship, Coley &amp; Maria perform a very sexual dance for the tourists. While he continues the show alone, Kit seduces Maria in her cabin below. Two followers of The Black Widow set fire to the ship and kidnap Coley. Harry stays behind and just barely manages to rescue Kit &amp; Maria. On the island, one of his kidnappers warns Coley of what's in store for him.

Night of the Golden Cock: In front of the assembled villagers, Coley enacts a voodoo ritual, and seduces Kit. Afterwards, she feels spellbound, and can't bring herself to leave him. He suggests they "get busy."

The Black Widow: In front of her followers, The Black Widow has her way with Coley, intending to kill him when she's finished.  But Coley's voodoo powers come into play, and turn the tables -- fatally. After most of her followers have fled, one of his kidnappers frees Coley rather than killing him and the two of them wind up going at it while Lon &amp; Darryl watch. Later, Harry's very aware of how much killing anybody upsets Coley. But Coley finds that Kit intends to leave him, feeling she can't handle his lifestyle anymore. He begs her to stick around just long enough to see a voodoo ritual.
