  <Summary>More mysteries of Death Dealer's past are revealed as he learns his place in an upcoming war that threatens to destroy the world. But the cursed warrior is more concerned about saving the woman and child that restored a sliver of his humanity.

Kur and his brother Enki were searching for the ulitmate weapon to use against the Kazzak hordes that threatened their tribe. They found the resting place of such a weapon and once inside came face to face with a giant monster, a barrier and an inscription.

"To cross the shield, you must feed the beast something you love."

Enki is confused but before he can act Kur feeds his brother to the beast, which has two effects, one the barrier drops and two Enki curses Kur. Kur finds the ultimate weapon, a helm which when he put on, the Death Dealer speaks with him. Kur releases the Death Dealer on the monster and starts the curse.

Back in the present, Kur, The Sorceress and Death Dealer arrive in Angar and attack Pestilence's stronghold, in an attempt to rescue Amira and Mesh. The group is over run by Pestilence's forces and the Sorceress is knock out. It is then revealed that Pestilence is Enki who made a deal with a demon. It appears like Pestilence is going to sacrifice Mesh and Kur's only option is to release Death Dealer.

When Kur comes out of the berserker rage, he finds that Death Dealer accidently killed Mesh. Then it is revealed that that was part of Pestilence's plan and Admira was working with him. Kur realizing his acts have opened a portal to hell and that Mesh's soul is trapped there, jumps through the portal to hell.
