  <Series>Frank Frazetta's Death Dealer</Series>
  <Summary>Frank Frazetta's legendary creation Death Dealer returns to life in collaboration with Frazetta Girls! Critically acclaimed animation writer Mitch Iverson (Dota: Dragon's Blood, Voltron: Legendary Defender) joins world renowned artists Stefano Martino (Stranger Things) and Luis Antonio Delgado (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin) to bring you the first salvo in a major launch of new, related titles featuring characters envisioned by the Master himself! Bear witness to the beginning of an entire multiverse of Frazetta's most famous creations!

A mysterious figure on an undead horse, is looking for the Death Dealer and killing anyone who gets in his way.

The Death Dealer, also known as Kur, is somewhere in the countryside barely eking out a life of killing game and living in a cave deep underground. He keeps talking to a voice that only he can hear, which seems like part of curse. On one of his hunting trips, he hears a woman in trouble. Admira and the baby Mesh are fleeing from a pack of wolves. Against Kur's better judgement he helps them. With the help of Admira's magic he is able to save them.

Admira begs him to help her find a place out of the impeding storm. With great reluctance he agrees and takes her and the baby to his cave. Then in the cave, Kur starts to have feeling for Mesh and once the baby is asleep, he makes love to Admira.

Then afterward, Kur goes deeper into the cave to find food. There he finds a pair of crocodile type monsters and is forced to call upon the mysterious powers of Death Dealer. This causes him to black out, but when he comes too, Admira and Mesh are missing, and the cave is covered in blood. It appears the figure from before has found the Death Dealer and with his army of undead have riden off with Admire and Mesh.
