Harry and Dan are bound and gagged. Mr. C tells them Tracey's stunt cost him $500,000 and she has to sign a contract merging her company with his. After a failed attempt by Dan to overtake the mobsters Betty Eden's father enters carrying a shotgun. He kills Mr. C and Pex and is about to kill Eddie when Tracey stops him. She confronts him with having raped his own daughter, which he denies. Unseen by them, Glenn takes Pex's gun and kills Mr. Eden.

Her secretary shows them a newspaper with Tracey's photo and the headline "Porn Star Underage". Later Ms. Tree talks to Sgt. Callis of the Vice Squad who confirms Tracey had been making kiddie porn. Ms. Tree returns to Graham's place but is surprised by Mr. C and his henchman.
