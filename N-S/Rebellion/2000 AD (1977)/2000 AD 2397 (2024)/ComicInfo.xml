  <Summary>I am Tharg The Mighty, the iconic alien editor at the helm of this world-shaking weekly! 

Welcome once again, my Squaxx, to Thrillcentral, where I recommend you steel your diodes before entering - within these pages, the excitement levels are red-lining alarmingly.

Even I have been given pause to wonder if you Terrans can handle such high-octane action - in the past, I&#8217;ve been blas&#233; about my droids&#8217; concerns that I&#8217;m overloading the Galaxy&#8217;s Greatest with just too much zarjazosity, and have always believed that not only can you deal with it, but also actively hunger for more. But I look at the prog before me, shuddering with barely contained energy, and it makes me question whether I should be responsible for unleashing such scrotnig Thrills upon your reality&#8230; &#8230;and of course the answer is yes!

It would be remiss of me not to test the limits of your Thrill-absorption, so you&#8217;ll find within the circuitshattering latest episodes of Judge Dredd, Silver, Brink, Herne &amp; Shuck and Rogue Trooper.

Enjoy, Earthlets, and know that we&#8217;re riding by the seat of our interstellar jumpsuits as we plunge into the outer limits of cosmic entertainment!

*Rogue Trooper &#187; Recon (Part 5)*
Nu Earth, site of a galactic war between the Norts and the Southers, where the atmosphere has been rendered poisonous. So the Southers created the Genetic Infantrymen, bred to be immune to the pollutants - G.I.s like ROGUE TROOPER, the last of his kind.

*Brink &#187; Consumed (Part 20)*
The late 21st century, and through environmental catastrophe and industrial overload Earth has been reduced to a wasteland. Mankind finally evacuated the planet in 2072 and millions were housed in a number of deep-space Habitats. But life on these cramped, overcrowded stations is tense, often spilling over into madness. Sects are rife, and Bridget Kurtis of the Habitat Security Division is investigating their reach...

*Silver &#187; Unearthed: book 1 (Part 7)*
Earth, the year 2001. A group of armed survivors sought out the resting place of a five hundred-year-old vampire, who may just help them against the alien Sepsis, who invaded the planet a few decades earlier.
