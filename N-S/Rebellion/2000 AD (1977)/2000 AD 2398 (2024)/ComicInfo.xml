  <Summary>Welcome to a world of Thrills as I, Tharg The Mighty, energise your imaginations once again! 

Surely he couldn&#8217;t, could he&#8230;? Is that Judge Joe Dredd on the cover, a riot blaster under his chin, threatening to pull the trigger unless the Mechanismo robots stand down? Well, yes it is, and as to what the outcome of the stand-off will be&#8230; well, you&#8217;ll just have to steel your Thrill-circuits and read the ghafflebette final episode of Machine Rule contained within this very pulse-pounding prog. Also ending this issue is the current run of Rogue Trooper - but, fear not, the G.I. will be back in a fortnight - and we reach the penultimate parts of both Silver and Herne &amp; Shuck!

All of which means we&#8217;re close to clearing the slate ahead of the scrotnig Prog 2400, which downloads into this reality on 18 September. Like previous event issues, this is a special that will cross over into Judge Dredd Megazine 472, out the very same day, so make sure you have your order in place if you&#8217;re not a regular Meg reader, as you&#8217;re not going to want to miss the complete story.

When the Norts invade the 2000 AD multiverse, the results are going to be galaxy-shaking - the countdown to war starts now!

*Rogue Trooper &#187; Recon (Part 6)*
Nu Earth, site of a galactic war between the Norts and the Southers, where the atmosphere has been rendered poisonous.

*Brink &#187; Consumed (Part 21)*
The late 21st century, and through environmental catastrophe and industrial overload Earth has been reduced to a wasteland. Mankind finally evacuated the planet in 2072 and millions were housed in a number of deep-space Habitats. But life on these cramped, overcrowded stations is tense, often spilling over into madness. Sects are rife, and Bridget Kurtis of the Habitat Security Division is investigating their reach...

*Silver &#187; Unearthed: book 1 (Part 8)*
Earth, the year 2001. A group of armed survivors sought out the resting place of a five hundred-year-old vampire, who may just help them against the alien Sepsis, who invaded the planet a few decades earlier.
