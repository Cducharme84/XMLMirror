	<Summary>Call me The Mighty Tharg, Betelgeusian overlord at the helm of this awesome anthology! 

This prog a new story joins the ghafflebette line-up of Judge Dredd, Brink, Proteus Vex and Intestinauts as script-droid David Baillie and artbot Nick Brokenshire collaborate on the latest 3riller to be fired from my Thrill-creation tank, Blue Skies Over Deadwick! Talking of blue skies, at the time of writing it looks like spring in the UK has finally arrived, and the incessant rain that marked April has at last ceased and been replaced by some warmer days.

It makes little difference to my creator-meks - they toil in their work-cubicles whatever the weather, and the Galaxy’s Greatest Comic is delivered onto the shuttles every week regardless - but even for a being from Quaxxann such as myself, spend enough time in the UK and you become involved in the national obsession.

If the Command Module had landed in a different country back in 1977, maybe I wouldn’t be as interested as the varying temperatures outside the Nerve Centre - but for a twist of the navi- comp, 2000 AD could be coming to you from the North Pole, and Judge Shako would be the lead character…

*Judge Dredd » Iron Teeth (Part 2)*
Mega-City One, 2146 AD. Home to over 200 million citizens, this urban hell is situated along the east coast of post-apocalyptic North America, where poverty and overcrowding is rife and tensions run a constant knife-edge. Crime is rampant, and only future cops the Judges - empowered to dispense instant justice - can stop total anarchy. Toughest of them all is JUDGE DREDD - he is the Law!

*INTESTINAUTS » Busted Flush (Part 2)*
For stomach upsets, future technology has developed nano-robots called INTESTINAUTS, who fight parasites in the gut. These micro-droids are ingested orally, then once their brave battle against the various horrors that can be found in the stomach is over, they take the Big Flush, ready to be uploaded back to headquarters, where their accrued knowledge of the enemy will help them in future missions...

*Tharg's 3rillers Present » Blue Skies Over deadwick (Part 1)*
Three episodes, one complete, self-contained story - a condensed hit of super-charged Thrill-power beamed to you directly from the Nerve Centre! Earth, the far future. Three climbers have been tasked with an important mission, one that cannot afford to fail. They have heard the rumble, and so must make the arduous, dangerous ascent if they are to save their settlement of Deadwick...

*Brink » Consumed (Part 6)*
The late 21st century, and through environmental catastrophe and industrial overload Earth has been reduced to a wasteland. Mankind finally evacuated the planet in 2072 and millions were housed in a number of deep-space Habitats. But life on these cramped, overcrowded stations is tense, often spilling over into madness. Sects are rife, and Bridget Kurtis of the Habitat Security Division is investigating their reach...

*PROTEUS VEX » Devious (Part 9)*
The far future. The centuries-long war between the Alliance and the Obdurate people is over, a conflict ended when the Alliance teleported a dying white dwarf star into the Obdurate system. Imperium agent PROTEUS VEX - who is operated by a flesh-pilot - became an enemy of the Alliance when he released info about past war crimes. In the wake of the war with the Scorchers, Vex is missing, presumed dead...</Summary>
