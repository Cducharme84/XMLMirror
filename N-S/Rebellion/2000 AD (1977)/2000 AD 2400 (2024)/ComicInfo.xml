  <Summary>I am The Mighty Tharg, all-powerful alien editor of this eye-popping SF anthology! 

We mark another benchmark issue - two thousand four hundred progs! How on Quaxxann did that happen? - with a special crossover event. In previous years, we&#8217;ve had the zombie variants of the characters and the &#8216;What if&#8230;?&#8217; of the Battle Action merger - but this time, it&#8217;s war!

Yes, in this particular alternate take on 2000 AD history, the Norts, having defeated the Southers, have sought new worlds to conquer, and Nu Earth&#8217;s nearby black hole gives them the opportunity to invade multiple other universes. So, just as Dredd and co are fending off the Sovs at the height of the Apocalypse War, a new enemy joins the fray. And it&#8217;s not just Mega-City One that&#8217;s coming under attack - Bad Company, the V.C.s, Major Eazy and more are facing the might of the Nordland Empire, and will have to collaborate to strike back&#8230;

This is a story too big to contain in just one 48-page issue, so it carries on into Judge Dredd Megazine 472 - handily, on sale the very same day as this pulse-pounding prog! So prepare for an epic battle, Terrans, as Kano, Hershey, Jupe and Constanta team up for the very first time&#8230;

*Judge Dredd &#187; Nordland Rising (Part 1)*
Mega-City One, 2104 AD. Home to over 800 million citizens, this urban hell is situated along the east coast of post-apocalyptic North America. Crime is rampant, and only the Judges - empowered to dispense instant justice - can stop total anarchy. Toughest of them all is JUDGE DREDD - he is the Law! Now, East-Meg One has launched an all-out nuclear attack on MC-1, followed by an invasion...

*Bad Company &#187; The Torture Farm (Part 1)*
vicious war between mankind and the alien Krool. They&#8217;ve been in deadly conflict for several years now, with little progress - the Krool&#8217;s ruthlessness and penchant for sadistic torture has made them a formidable foe. But a rumour has emerged of a strange outfit operating behind enemy lines, called BAD COMPANY...

*The V.C.'s &#187; Norts &amp; Double-Crosses (Part 1)*
The Earth solar system, the twenty-sixth century. No one knew where the alien Geeks came from, but they sure weren&#8217;t friendly. When they started attacking mankind&#8217;s outposts, it was up to the Global Combat Corps to protect the galaxy. Otherwise known as THE V.C.s - the Vaccuum Cleaners, because they clear-up the spaceways - this team of heavily armoured marines go where they&#8217;re needed to tackle the Geek menace...

*Fiends Of The Eastern Front &#187; What's Bred in The Bone (Part 1)*
Earth, the Second World War. As the German Army battles the Russians, one particular platoon found itself allied with a Romanian squad, led by the brutal Captain Constanta. The Romanian soldiers were hungry for revenge against the Soviets, but little did the Germans realise that Constanta and his crew were in fact vampires - and their bloodlust meant anyone was a target...

*Jaegir &#187; 100 Million Martyrs (Part 1)*
The Greater Nordland Republic. While the Norts were engaged in a galaxy-wide war with the Souther forces, it fell to military officers such as Kapiten-Inspector Atalia JAEGIR of the Nordland State Security Police to investigate war criminals amongst her own ranks. The daughter of War Marshal Josef Jaegir, she&#8217;s also suffering from the Strigoi curse, a fault in the Nort DNA that can bring out the beast within...

*Major Eazy &#187; Afrika Norts (Part 1)*
The African desert, 1942. During the Allied campaign, few officers were as singular as Major Eazy - long-haired and laconic, this scruffy maverick never failed to irritate his superiors. With a cigar hanging from his lips and often found driving his distinctive Bentley, Eazy seemed crazy - but his eccentricities were overlooked because when it came to warfare, he always gets the job done...</Summary>
