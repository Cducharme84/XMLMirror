	<Summary>Call me Tharg The Mighty, Thrill-channelling, cosmically charged superbeing from Betelgeuse!

Back to normal service this prog, my Squaxx — or as normal as the Galaxy’s Greatest Comic can ever be, considering we’re dealing with several planes of reality just in one issue — after last week’s bumper edition, and within these pulse-pounding pages you’ll find the start of a new Dredd story by the Williams and Guera droids as well as a complete Terror Tale from debuting script-bot Jon Lock and art-mek Richard Elson, alongside the latest instalments of Full Tilt Boogie, Indigo Prime and Proteus Vex!

As we plunge into April and the skies brighten, the trees bud with life and the dark evenings of winter are left behind, no doubt your human spirits soar a little, the sense of growth that comes with spring revitalising your mood. It’s well established that the seasons affect you Terrans’ outlook, which can ebb and rise over the course of a year — but one thing that is consistent, that will always bring you joy, intrigue and excitement no matter what the weather, is, of course, my illustrious organ.

Every week you can rely upon the fact that 2000 AD’s a guaranteed circuit-shatterer!

*Judge Death » Rend &amp; Tear with Tooth &amp; Claw (Part 1)*
Mega-City One, 2146 AD. Home to over 200 million citizens, this urban hell is situated along the east coast of post-apocalyptic North America, with the toxic Black Atlantic to the east and the irradiated Cursed Earth to the west.

*Indigo Prime » Black Monday (Part 6)*
The multiverse. There is an infinite number of parallel realities, and all need managing in case of dimensional instability. This is where INDIGO PRIME came in, the multiverse’s troubleshooters, whose agents are trained to deal with space/time catastrophes. Now, IP’s HQ has been destroyed in a cataclysmic event, with most of the personnel lost, and its assets acquired by the company ICP...

*PROTEUS VEX » Devious (Part 2)*
