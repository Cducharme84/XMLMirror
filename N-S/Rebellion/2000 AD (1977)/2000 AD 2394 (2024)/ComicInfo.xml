  <Summary>I am The Mighty Tharg, Betelgeusian brainiac and channeller of cosmic Thrill-power!

Welcome back to the Galaxy&#8217;s Greatest Comic, Terrans, for another eye-popping thirty-two pages of scintillating sci-fi - and welcome back to art-droid Simon Harrison, who crafts this prog&#8217;s ghafflebette cover. It&#8217;s been incredibly thirty years since the Harrison-bot&#8217;s work last appeared below the 2000 AD logo - Prog 885, to be exact, back when Bradley the Sprog was a pint-sized terror - so it&#8217;s scrotnig to see him once again within these pages!

No let up in the sheer zarjazosity emanating from inside this issue, either - we plunge into August and the excitement is pushing red-hot levels as the Mechanismo robots make their move in Machine Rule; Bridget&#8217;s investigations gain momentum in Consumed; Baroness DeSilva meets the human rebels pressing her into helping them save the planet from the alien Sepsis in Silver; Rogue has a race on his hands to get to the mysterious ET before other interested parties in Recon; and Herne &amp; Shuck come face to face with the sinister St Michael organisation in Suffer the Children.

Can your circuits handle it, humes?

Mega-City One, 2146 AD. Home to over 200 million citizens, this urban hell is situated along the east coast of post-apocalyptic North America. Crime is rampant, and only future cops the Judges - empowered to dispense instant justice - can stop total anarchy. Toughest of them all is JUDGE DREDD - he is the Law! The Mark 8 Mechanismo robot Judges have been on the streets for several years now...

*Rogue Trooper &#187; Recon (Part 2)*
Nu Earth, site of a galactic war between the Norts and the Southers, where the atmosphere has been rendered poisonous. So the Southers created the Genetic Infantrymen, bred to be immune to the pollutants - G.I.s like ROGUE TROOPER, the last of his kind. Together with biochip buddies Helm, Gunnar and Bagman, they&#8217;re searching for the traitor that sold them out...

*Herne &amp; Shuck &#187; Suffer The Children (Part 3)*
The UK, 2024. Herne is a troubleshooter and hired help for many different magical factions in the country. Accompanied by Shuck, a demon in dog form, he travels the country picking up work where he can, whether it be exorcism or a rescue. Recently, he was tasked with saving a young girl called Carys, only to find out she was scheduled for ritual sacrifice. The pair are now trying to get the child to safety...

*Brink &#187; Consumed (Part 17)*
The late 21st century, and through environmental catastrophe and industrial overload Earth has been reduced to a wasteland. Mankind finally evacuated the planet in 2072 and millions were housed in a number of deep-space Habitats. But life on these cramped, overcrowded stations is tense, often spilling over into madness. Sects are rife, and Bridget Kurtis of the Habitat Security Division is investigating their reach...

*Silver &#187; Unearthed: book 1 (Part 5)*
Earth, the year 2001. A group of armed survivors sought out the resting place of a five hundred-year-old vampire, who may just help them against the alien Sepsis, who invaded the planet a few decades earlier.
