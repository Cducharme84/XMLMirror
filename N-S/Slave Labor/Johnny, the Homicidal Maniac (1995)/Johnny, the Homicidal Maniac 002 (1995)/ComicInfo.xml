  <Series>Johnny, the Homicidal Maniac</Series>
  <Summary>Johnny captures a man named Edgar Vargas, who he recognizes as an innocent and apologizes to for needing his blood. Vargas explains that, because of his faith, he is not afraid of death, and Johnny kills him, but lacks his usual sense of satisfaction. Johnny captures a beautiful woman and tells her that he will spare her because he is better than her, but then kills her with a scythe anyway when he realizes that they are both just as ugly on the inside. Johnny goes on a date with Devi, a cashier at a local bookstore; torn between his infatuation and his need to satiate his deeper psychotic urges, he attempts to stab her, but Devi escapes after nearly killing Johnny. Later in the issue, Johnny makes a late-night run to a "24/7" convenience store for a "Cherry Brain Freezy" and after the store clerk tells him he can't have one because they shut the machines off at 2:00 am (in the story, this particular part takes place at 2:15 am, as it says in a little caption)he then proceeded to kill the man, but is unable to kill himself having used the one bullet in the gun.
