When they return home Jake is waiting.  Jake is upset, and says he left Spence with Melba so that Melba could "teach her girl stuff."  Melba tries to convince him that they were going to use the lizards as earrings.  Jakes picks up Spence and storms off, as the lizards are hanging from Melba's ears.

Zero Hour: PJ and Ant have just gotten the Internet on their computer, but they only have 10 hours of free use.  While PJ is doing housework Ant explores the Internet, spending over 14 hours checking out websites about Pez, Hello Kitty, the Olympics, and eventually sites with nude pictures and chat rooms.  Finally after 14 hours PJ pulls the plug on the computer, just as Ant says she's trying to download a pot rose recipe from someone in Boise.

A Bird in the Hand: Beck and an unnamed man are walking and see large crows eating songbirds.  A songbird flees, flying toward Beck.  She holds up her hand to catch it in order to save it from the pursuing crow, but it hits the palm of her hand so hard it dies.  The man then points toward a petting zoo, and Beck starts rubbing the underside of the beaks of a platypus, and then she wakes up.

Gene, Gene the Dancing Machine: Gene can't sleep so he watches a PBS fund-raising special, then falls asleep and dreams of dancing, and wakes up and realizes he is hungry.

Tobey &amp; Nicky in 'Girls in the Bathroom': Tobey and Nicky are in the bathroom of a bar to avoid having to talk to a couple of guys.  Tobey is wracked by doubt about the quality of her cartooning work.  Nicky tells Tobey to quit over-thinking things.  They go back out, the guys ask what they were talking about, and are relieved when Tobey and Nicky simultaneously say "clothes."
