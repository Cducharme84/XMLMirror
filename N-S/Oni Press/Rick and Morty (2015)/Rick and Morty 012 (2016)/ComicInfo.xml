SynopsisAt breakfast, Jerry is upset to learn that Rick has rigged the toaster to make lighter toast. At Beth's suggestion, Jerry enters the garage to ask Rick for a screwdriver to fix the toaster. Instead, Jerry finds Rick's head on the garage counter. The family goes into a panic, as they don't know where Morty is. The panic turns Jerry and Beth against each other, but their fight is interrupted by loud noises from the garage.

Summer attempts to find Morty by opening a portal and scanning for his life signs. None are found, however, and the portal explodes. Jerry and Beth begin their fight again only to have Summer bark at them about the pointlessness of the universe. Jerry and Beth stop fighting and decide to work together to save their remaining child.

Elsewhere, Rick and Morty are in a firefight with some aliens. Rick explains to the confused Morty that he found the head of another Rick whose very similar universe (with a slightly accelerated timeline) had been destroyed by aliens. Those same aliens are now at Rick's Earth and Rick has entered the brain of the head to figure out why the aliens are there and how to defeat them. Inside a Rick's head, Rick feels powerful - nearly limitless. He and Morty find an escape pod and flee the aliens right as the armada explodes due to some meddling by Rick of the alien technology. 

But the escape is jeopardized when Rick realizes that the head he and Morty are in must be dying. Outside, a funeral is held for Rick and Morty. The head is buried. Rick explains that the only thing keeping Rick and Morty from dying themselves are the last remaining synapses firing in the buried Rick's head. As a last ditch effort, Rick and Morty jump into the brain/memories of the dead Rick's dead Morty.
