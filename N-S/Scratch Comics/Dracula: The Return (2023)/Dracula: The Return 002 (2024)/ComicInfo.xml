  <Summary>That's right, folks! After a year, the official Stokerverse sequel to Dracula continues from the cliffhanger at the end of the first book! This is not the sparkly Dracula of Hollywood. This is the terrifying monster of Bram Stoker's original novel, and our surviving band of heroes are in for the fight of their lives! Written by Dacre Stoker and Chris McAuley with visuals by the returning art team of Chris Geary and Matt Soffe, and a stunning back up strip by David Hitchcock, this second instalment of "Cult of the White Worm" introduces a new character into Dracula's plan for revenge! Not only that, the 9 page back up strip in this double sized issue will unveil a huge revelation about, not only Dracula, but about Bram Stoker himself.</Summary>
