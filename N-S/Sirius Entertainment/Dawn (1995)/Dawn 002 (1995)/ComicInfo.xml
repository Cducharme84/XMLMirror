In heaven Dawn has an appointment with God who tasks her with retrieving Lucifer's halo for him. They discuss Lucifer's fall from grace and the relationship between him and God. It is revealed that the halo is a bridge between Hell and Heaven and a symbol of their love for each other that needs to be broken. Dawn is seen as impartial and Lucifer is more likely to respond to her than an army of angels.

Lucifer is charming and Dawn is completely honest about the reason for her visit. Lucifer becomes enraged at Dawn when she mis identifies a quote from Macbeth but it has the desired effect and Lucifer gives her the halo.
