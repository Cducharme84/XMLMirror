Lucifer stands with his back to Raksas the while time he questions him, viewing the skyline.&#160;&#160;When he turns his face has IDIOT written across the forehead and 3 Dawn-like tears painted below his left eye. Phased Raksas continues to praise Lucifer's actions without question. Lucifer allows him to leave saying theres a woman outside waiting for him.&#160;As he leaves he finds Lucifer's secretary reduced to a bloody mess as Dawn decapitates him.&#160;&#160;Dawns left eye flames but has no effect on Lucifer but her sword does as she cuts his cheek. She challenges him why he is killing all her witches. He claims its because there is so much psychic energy here and the more non believers he removes the more there are for him.
