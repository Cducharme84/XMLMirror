REPORT: 1:59.18A.M (GS). Nelathon sensores recorded a massive, violent energy fluctuatution in the recently rediscovered Malay system. Astronomical analysis indicates a massive planetary upheavel, with an 82% chance that the planet concerned is Malay. Current data indicates planetary destruction may have occurred.

Nelathon sensors also recorded several secondary energy expenditures on different wavelengths consistent with the uncontrolled release of several trillion Hadrons, such as those contained in PLAN*NET starcraft HID's. Aimbore Lens 13 and 14 will remain focused on malay systems for a full cycle. updates to follow.

*About*
a prelogue to the series, this issue of Xander tells us about the origins of Xander.

====SPOILERS====

We are told that Xander is was born in a laboratory, he is a clone. on the planet Malay. Xander is one month old (the clone) and seems to have been created with the same consciousness as his original however doesn't seem to know anything about who he is or his purpose.

suddenly the city that he lives in is attacked by Lady Sensua's army. a graphic battle ensues and Xander introduces some of the major characters that are in the series or make meaning to future references.

Xander gathers a group of refugees and takes them to safety in an underground cavern. in this cavern they find a great room filled with technology that Xander remembers being in the lab he was created in. Walker presses a button and a Black Ghost appears and informs them that The Evil One (Lady Sensua) must not be allowed to escape with what she came for and that Malay will be destroyed in thirty minutes.

this issue ends with the group barely managing to escape in a small ship.
