  <Series>Forgotten Realms: Sojourn</Series>
  <Summary>War comes to Montolio's grove, and he and Drizzt must defend the place by themselves. The Orc Chieftain Graul has been joined by Drizzt's old enemies Roddy McGristle, and Tephanis who has allied himself with the great Winter Wolf Caroak.

 They are successful, leaving Drizzt, Guen, and Montolio to live out the coming winter in peace. Montolio passes away just as the first winter snows begin to fall. Drizzt moves on, going from town to town, and facing rejection after rejection at each guarded gate.

 After falling in with a group of Weeping Friars, he learn about the settlements known as Ten Towns in the frozen north of Icewind Dale. Traveling there, he is yet again turned away at the largest settlement, Bryn Shander, but is told by the town Spokesman, Cassius, that he can prove his worth to the community by serving as watchman atop Kelvin's Cairn.

 Drizzt is soon met by Cattie-Brie, a human fosterling taken in by the local dwarven King, Bruenor Battlehammer. Though she has heard about the atrocities perpetrated by evil drow, she is not afraid of him, and soon develops a fast friendship with the dark elf. Even when Bruenor discovers the relationship, and forbids it, she continues to sneak out and meet with him as often as she can.

 When Roddy McGristle arrives and accuses the drow as usual, Bruenor listens without much belief, and tosses the human out after he upsets Cattie-Brie. Angered yet again, Bruenor tells her to not see the drow, a command she immediately disobeys, running to ask the dark elf the truth of the fate of the Thistledown family. Roddy follows the girl secretly, and uses her as a hostage against Drizzt. When Drizzt has opportunity to kill Roddy, he does not, but merely knocks him unconscious. Later on, Bruenor finds him, threatens him to leave and never come back, taking the leg of his beloved dog in the process.

 Roddy leaves, and Bruenor finally meets Drizzt. He charges the dark elf with his daughter's safety, effectively welcoming the drow to Icewind Dale. Drizzt had finally found a home.</Summary>
