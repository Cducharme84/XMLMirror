  <Summary>Werewolves and Cat-women storm the cast of CAPCOM's incomparably evil DARKSTALKERS series as fan-favorites FELICIA and TALBAIN make their debut! As the world deals with the rise of paranormal activity, life has been much harder on those whose heritage lies somewhere between human and Darkstalker. Felicia, a cat-woman, has found it increasingly difficult to pursue her dreams of an acting career as society becomes less accepting of her kind. Meanwhile, the werewolf Talbain, hunted and hated for most of his life, has received even less tolerance. In this story featuring guest artist KEVIN (Iron Fist, Vampi) LAU and ALVIN (Street Fighter, Agent X) LEE, Felicia and Talbain's lives collide as one seeks to find peace with humanity while the other wishes to shun it. PLUS! A spine-tingling backup story featuring the Prince of Darkness, DEMITRI!                   Talbain and Felicia make their debut in the series in this issue and are the the issue's main stars. There's even a look at how Cat-Women in general are viewed by society.

 Felicia finds it increasingly difficult to pursue her dreams of an acting career. She comes to the aid of Talbain, who instead attacks her and calls her a human sympathizer; she manges to put down the injured werewolf and nurses him back to health. She plans on showing him that not all human beings are bad.

 There's also a back-up story featuring Demitri.
