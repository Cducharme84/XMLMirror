  <Summary>Part 2 of the enthralling PINOCCHIO collection is here! This is the MUST-READ conclusion to the terrifying story of the wooden puppet who longed to by a real boy. Gepetto attempts to rescue his son who refuses to give up on. But a vicious evil stirs inside of Pinnochio and it might be too late for Gepetto to help him. Can a fatherâ€™s love prove to be enough to save the wooden boy or will evil prevail and doom Gepetto once and for all?

As the story picks up, the father asks what his son has done, but when he doesn't answer he allows him to go to school by himself so that he can stay at home and read some more of the fairy tale. After killing the two thieves Pinocchio was dragged into the water, and his father goes in after him. The two are then swallowed by a whale. Gepetto makes a deal with Pinocchio, allowing him to go free provided he try to reform, while he must stay in the whale's stomach. A fairy comes to rescue him and tells him he must be there for Pinocchio. He escapes and when he finds Pinocchio he finds he has killed more, and then Pinocchio kills him as well. The fairy then shows up and reveals she had intended this all along. When the father in the real world finishes reading this he finds his son has set his school on fire. He runs in to rescue him but chooses to leave him to die and rescues another girl instead. Belinda drives away with the boy (now transformed into a wooden person) alongside her.
