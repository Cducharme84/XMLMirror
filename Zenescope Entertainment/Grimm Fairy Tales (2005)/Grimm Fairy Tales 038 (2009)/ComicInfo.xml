  <Summary>Cage-fighting manager Steve Roden discovered Michael Lyons on the rough streets of North Philly and took a chance on a kid who ultimately became one of the best mixed martial arts fighters in the world. Now Lyons is in the twilight of his career and preparing to fight his final bout, a fight that can sure up his legacy. But before he gets inthe ring he must make the most difficult decision of his entire life. Can Lyons ultimately swallow his pride to help the man who took a chance on him or will ego get in the way of the sometimes gray area between right and wrong?                  Michael's story begins as a young drug dealer on the streets of Philadelphia.  A random man witnesses him intimidating others and offers him a way out, through ultimate fighting.  He accepts, and then the action cuts to years later when he is at the last fight at the end of an undefeated career.  The man who is now his manager insists he fight while his trainer insists he doesn't because of a sore shoulder.  Michael then accidentally discovers that his manager owes the mob a favour and him losing that night was that favour.  Sela comes in, and drops her book, in which Michael reads the Lion and the Mouse.  In this modified story the mouse frees the lion from a cage in which he was to be sent to a zoo.  The lion doesn't understand at first the concept of generosity, but then later does and becomes a benevolent leader.  Later still in his old years he sees the mouse again, this time being tormented by younger lions, and knowing that he will be injured and lose his title, the lion goes to save his friend.  The story then cuts back to modern day, where Michael realizes his manager has gotten him to where he is and that he would be dead without him.  He fights the fight to the point that he knows he would have won, then he loses.
