  <Summary>Spending the majority of their time getting high and committing random crimes, 3 slackers soon find themselves taken on a nightmare journey with their impromptu guide, Sela Mathers. After continuous run-ins with people who refuse to heed her advice, Sela has decided to start using more drastic measures. With the help of the Big Bad Wolf, Sela makes her most unforgettable impression by showing the three friends that certain people don't deserve a second chance.

The story for the first time directly involves Sela as she tells a modified version of the story of the Three Little Pigs. The characters are filled by a trio of miscreant youths, one of whom used to be her student. She uses her powers to transform the boys into pigs and examines the misdeeds in their respective lives. As in the fairy tale the first two houses are made of straw and wood and the wolf (representing punishment) easily captures the two, but the third and the one which Sela hopes to save is in the brick house. She thinks there are some redeemable qualities in him, that he was just "hanging out with the wrong crowd" but upon discovering this not to be true she allows him to face his punishment as well.
