  <Summary>Sela’s change in attitude has spawned something she never saw coming as she receives a visit from the powerful being that granted her powers. The beautiful and mysterious heroine finds herself pulled directly into the very same world she’s summoned so many others into. Now it’s time for the teacher to learn a lesson of her own and to make a choice that will affect not only her future but the lives of those who will need her.

After waking from a dream, Sela finds herself transported to another realm where she plays the part of Little Miss Muffet. She is forced to face many of the antagonists of her actions over the course of her actions as the owner of the fairy tale book. She also faces against a spider that has her trapped in its web. She later comes face to face with the man that has given her the book in the first place as she had yet to know who or what he was. After discussing with him the morality of her recent actions in letting people suffer from their actions, she confronts the antagonists again before facing her past in another dreamlike sequence.
