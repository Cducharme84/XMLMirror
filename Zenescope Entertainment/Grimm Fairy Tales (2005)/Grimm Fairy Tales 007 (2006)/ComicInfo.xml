	<Summary>A mysterious illness befalls a high school cheerleader while her caring stepmother stays home to tend to her. But when a heinous act of betrayal is revealed, one person knows such actions can never go unpunished as a journey into Grimm Fairy Tales beginsâ€¦ A beautiful princess becomes the envy of her aging step-mother and nothing will stop the jealous Queen from remaining the most beautiful woman in the land. But when her jealousy is taken too far the Queen finds that the wrath coming her way is unlike anything she could have ever imagined.

This issue juxtaposes the story of Snow White against that of a step-mother and caregiver to her step-daughter who has Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. Sela shows up and insists that the daughter read the story of Snow White, and suggests that maybe the step-mother might like to as well. In so doing she reads a story which is slightly different in which the Evil Queen is first sends the Huntsman after Snow White and then uses a poison apple. The Seven Dwarfs are reimagined as consumers of the evil, and after deeming that Snow White needs protection, they decide to eat the Queen alive as punishment. In the modern day the step mother is shown in an asylum as she thinks the Dwarfs are trying to eat her as well.
