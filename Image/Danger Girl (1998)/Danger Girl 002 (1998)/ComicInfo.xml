  <Summary>Abbey Chase and the other Danger Girls lose The Peach as he and his goons master their escape. Abbey destroys two helicopters in the process, the last by removing the grenade pin of the sniper before falling comfortably onto the tarpaulin top of a truck Sydney Savage is driving.

Picking up the trail, the Danger Girls head for Interlaken, Switzerland after hitching a ride by a kind rural french man, who we find out is Secret Agent Zero in disguise. Interlaken is a swiss alps resort where they believe the first part of the mystic armor - the shield - is being held by The Peach. Abbey and Sydney rendevous with girl magnet agent Johnny Barracuda, the undercover guest of a soiree attended by The Peach. Johnny, as the producer Ooter Frumpenpuff, and Abbey, as his date, make an unsubtle appearance at the party. Sydney and Natalia Kassle join as undercover waitresses and Abbey takes the opportunity to sniff around. The Peach is talking with two German twins known only as Cain and Abel

Meanwhile, Johnny Barracuda runs across Kid Dynamo, who seemingly has been on the wrong end of Johnny's attention previously. Abbey, making her way upstairs in search of the shield, finds what she is looking for only to be interupted by The Peach. Cue final panel of Abbey in bubble bath.</Summary>
