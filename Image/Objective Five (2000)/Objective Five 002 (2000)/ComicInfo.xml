  <Summary>Warning: The Virus is Spreading" The Center for Disease Control (CDC) is serious about stopping the proliferation of bio-weapons. To that end, they are training their newest agents, Lark, Alexis and DJ. Three people infected with a DNA enhancing retrovirus. Their special condition allows the CDC to use a power no one else has. As the three hone their new found abilities, Lark and her team prepare for their first assignment. We also learn that their friend, Simon, has recovered from his injuries. It turns out his father's company, with extensive investment in biological "development," is behind Simon's recovery. The company has great interest in the changes Simon has gone through... The collaborative group, Luke Lizalde, Danny Miki, and Tyson Wengler continue their 3 sided art attack, proving that teamwork equals excellence.</Summary>
