New York's destiny is written in its depths...

Alison Walker is a promising young painter in Manhattan. But she has a secret. She's also a witch. She and her family belong to the world of Under York, a mysterious, underground New York where five powerful clans of witches have reigned for centuries. These families with their strict codes of life, drawn from the country's main communities (African, Irish, Chinese, Mexican, and Amerindian) practice magic as powerful as it is dangerous. For generations, they have been hunted and persecuted. Today, they secretly influence life on the surface and its inhabitants. Their revenge is to participate in the destiny of a world that banished them. And this is the universe in which Alison Walker grew up. The universe she fled and doesn't want to hear about anymore. Until fate catches up with her...

Acclaimed French writer SYLVAIN RUNBERG (Watchdogs, Warship: Jolly Roger) and superstar Harvey Award winner MIRKA ANDOLFO deliver a fascinating tale, where urban fantasy takes root in the bowels of the world's most famous city. Two universes—that of contemporary New York and its dynamism and modernity, and that of the secret, underground magical clans of Under York—collide in the destiny of a young witch on the run.</Summary>
