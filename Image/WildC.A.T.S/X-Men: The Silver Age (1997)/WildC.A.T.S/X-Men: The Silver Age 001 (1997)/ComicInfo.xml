  <Series>WildC.A.T.S/X-Men: The Silver Age</Series>
  <Summary>This story takes place in the early days of the original X-Men and before the formation of the WildC.A.T.s. After being released from a South American prison by Nick Fury, Cole Cash is drafted by S.H.I.E.L.D. . to work as a field agent to investigate what appears to be an "alien invasion" and to recover an operative who has been captured in Sydney. At the same time, Jean Grey , on a flight to a modeling shoot in Sydney, is psionically accosted by the "aliens," who reveal themselves to be hybrids of The Brood and the Daemotes and who mistake Jean for a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent on the plane who has knowledge of a plot involving the hybrids. The hybrids kill the agent after the plane lands, but are themselves killed by a psionic blast from Cash. Jean telepathically learns the fallen agent's information before he dies, calms Cash after his psi-blast, helps him get past the police at the airport, and offers to help him complete his mission.

The news of the attack at the airport is reported by the human/ Kerhubim halfbreed assassin Pike to Mister Sinister, who is revealed to have created the hybrids and who has captured Zealot, the missing S.H.I.E.L.D operative. Cash and Jean infiltrate a cruise ship which is attacked by Pike and a swarm of hybrids, who capture the passengers so that Sinister can use them to incubate new hybrids. Cash and Jean resist, but are defeated by Pike; however, the rest of the X-Men arrive (having tracked Jean using Cerebro) and defeat Pike and the rest of the hybrids. Sinister escapes, unnoticed by anyone; Zealot is freed, and Jean and Cash part company.</Summary>
