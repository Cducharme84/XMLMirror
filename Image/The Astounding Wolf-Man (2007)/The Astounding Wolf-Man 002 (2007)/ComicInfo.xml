  <Series>The Astounding Wolf-Man</Series>
  <Summary>Gary Hampton puts his newly acquired powers to the test. Wolf-Man finally takes to the streets - saving lives and doing good. How will the public react to him - and can he control the beast within? Don't miss out on the first action-packed adventures of THE ASTOUNDING WOLF-MAN!

SPOILERS

The man who had previously confronted Gary was revealed to be named Zechariah and he had been training Gary for three weeks now. He explained that he did drink blood but not human blood and he rarely did it. Gary now had almost complete control over his beast form and even aided in a house fire; the media managed to see him and dubbed him the Wolf-Man. Zechariah decided it was time to make it official and he took Gary to the "tailor" to get a supersuit. The suit was designed to store lunar energy to help sustain the wolf form if needed. Wolf-Man later helped a group of super teens called The Actioneers fight off the slime monster Spore. The help was appreciated but Gary withdrew quickly to avoid confrontation. The next night while he was sleeping with his wife he accidentally transformed with no control. He ended up killing one of the heroes who'd helped him.
