  <Summary>Mike and Sarah are watching cartoons together. The female mutant explains that she used to have watch TV in her parent's basement as they chained her up down there because they thought she was a monster. Mikey is aghast and tells her that he thinks she's cute... and he kisses her. Mike gets self conscious and begins to apologize, but Sarah enthusiastically leaps into his arms, knocking him over, and begins kissing him. Just then a superheroine named Rapture walks in and flips out - she screams at Mike and tells him to get lost. The Turtle tries to explain, but the woman won't hear it and slams the door in his face. Mike walks off with a huge grin plastered on his face. Raphael, meanwhile, is really enjoying the bar fight that he's involved in.</Summary>
