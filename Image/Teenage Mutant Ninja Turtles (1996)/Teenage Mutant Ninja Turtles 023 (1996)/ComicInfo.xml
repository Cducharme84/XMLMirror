  <Summary>Leonardo is sparring with Mike in the sewers when Mikey gets in a shot with his nunchakus that knocks Leo's bionic hand off of his forearm. The two go back to April's apartment building and Leonardo complains to Donatello about the hand. The brainy Turtle states that he'll look at it in a minute - once he's finished making an exo-skeleton for Dr. X. The brothers stand the robotic body on its feet and Dr. X climbs in and is quickly walking around the room. The Utrom is very happy to be mobile once again. Leonardo asks Don about his hand, and the cycborg explains that they'll have to use some of his "living" armor to attach the hand permanently. Leo refuses to do this, and presents a metal cap that covers his stump that can produce a sword akin to how a switchblade works. Shadow arrives to tell the guys that April wants to see them and asks to keep Leonardo's unused bionic hand, which he gives her.</Summary>
