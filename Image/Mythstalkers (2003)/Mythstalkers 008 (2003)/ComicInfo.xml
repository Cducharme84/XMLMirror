  <Summary>The Society for Cryptozoological Research (colloquially known as the "Mythstalkers") is an adventurer's club dedicated to tracking down and studying the mythological creatures that are mysteriously returning to the world of 1893. Unfortunately, right now they're too busy trying to save themselves from a notorious London crimelord allied with the otherworldly Unseelie Court, a vengeful and beautiful faerie princess, and the scariest creatures ever found in pre-Seussian children's literature to do any investigation. Maybe next issue. "London Nights," Part Four of Four: Love Means Never Having To Say "I Will Return To Wreak Horrible Vengeance Upon You And Your Kin, Foolish Mortal." Lots available in Mythstalkers #8: 1 (one) human child, named Emmaline Chatterton. 1 (one) human soul, once belonging to Victor Terranove. 1 (one) transformed faerie nobleman, answers to Vastarin. The building at 1071 St. Davies Street, also known as "Headquarters for the Society of Cryptozoological Research." A 10,000 (ten thousand) pound debt marker owed to purported crime lord Mr. Fitzhugh. Control of London. All items must go by end of issue. Bids from heroes discouraged.</Summary>
