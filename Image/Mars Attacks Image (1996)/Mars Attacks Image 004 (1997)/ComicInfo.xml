  <Series>Mars Attacks Image</Series>
  <Summary>In Washington, D.C. Spartan is worried that the temporary defeat of Martian attackers was too easy. In Detroit we learn that Kid Avenger's bomb did not destroy the Command Headquarters, but in fact destroyed the surrounding city. Then Killcat is hit by a shrink ray and he and the rest of his team are captured by the Martians. Mighty Man continues to take out saucers in California, narrowly avoiding destroying one that had been taken by members of Gen 13 and Wetworks. The Martians announce to the people of Earth that it was they who had been attacked by Earth's super-heroes and that they would restore peace if the heroes are given up. The world's leaders unanimously reject this offer. In Detroit, the Martians repeatedly rape Liberty as part of a breeding experiment. In Washington, D.C. Backlash discovers the body of U.S. Male, who died protecting the copy of the U.S. Constitution housed in the Capitol Building. In Detroit the team escape, and in a fit of rage Justice kills the Martians who were experimenting on Liberty. The Martians communicate with Mars to ask for reinforcements, only to discover that Savage Dragon has destroyed and killed their Martian cities. The Martian fleet flees, and Earth's heroes begin to celebrate.</Summary>
