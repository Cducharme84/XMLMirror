  <Summary>500 Years Later. Mars.

The plot:

Riley has a dream...

In the 26th century, Mars is inhabited by humans and other aliens.

For some reason, Riley is still alive and kicking. She has traveled to Mars, to do something.

She needs and wants a fast way of transportation. The seller wants too much money for the vehicle he/she/other gender is selling. Riley wont have that. She shows that she isn`t someone to mess around with. She gets the vehicle with a reasonable prize.

She drives the helibike (or whatever it`s called) to the desert.

She meets Glory once again, like she intended. They haven`t seen each other for centuries. They talk. Talk about the fact that Glory caused the downfall of humans. That even if she won (or, as Riley says, "won") the war between two destructive forces, she destroyed most of human civilization. Things never became better on Earth.

We see Supreme and Glory act brutally against one another. 

When they`re done with talking, Riley asks Glory to do what she wants her to do.

Glory kills Riley.

Then she burns her corpse, and sheds a tear.

Riley wakes up. She knows that what she saw may be the future. She panics, and runs to Glorias room. She tells about her dream. Gloria tells Riley that her mission is to stop Glory from making the future very grim indeed.</Summary>
