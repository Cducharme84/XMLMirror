  <Summary>When Mark Grayson was a young child his father, Omni-Man, told him of his heritage: he was born on a planet called Viltrum, and chose to come to Earth as its protector. Since that day Mark has waited for his own super powers to develop, and when they do he takes up a costume and name - Invincible - and looks for his own way to be a hero.

While fighting an apparent game-console thief - a Mauler twin - Invincible is met by the Teen Team which includes a cute girl called Atom Eve. Atom Eve looks familiar, and she should: she goes to the same school as Mark!

Invincible and Atom, along with one more Team member - Robot - figure it'd be a good idea to see what the Mauler twin was up to. Why did he need so many game boxes? Seems that the Mauler twins need the processing power to run their robot army. That's obviously not a good thing, and the trio figure they'd better stop them.</Summary>
