  <Summary>Mark Grayson is the son of the most powerful superhero on the planet. Recently he's begun to inherit his father's powers, and in doing so, he has learned that everything he's been told is a lie. His father wasn't sent here to protect the planet, he was sent here to enslave it. The only thing that prevented him from succeeding was his own son. But he's still out there, and nobody knows when he will strike again. Mark and Amber's relationship is heating up now that they are in college and away from the prying eyes of parental supervision. Also in this issue, yet another person discovers Mark's secret identity. How does that Spider-Man guy do it? Oh, wait...never mind

Mark reveals to Amber, that he is Invincible and she is relieved to find out her boyfriend is not a drug dealer. Atom Eve is using her powers for good to help out man kind. Rick is kidnapped by D.A. Sinclair who plans on turning him into one of his Reanimen.</Summary>
