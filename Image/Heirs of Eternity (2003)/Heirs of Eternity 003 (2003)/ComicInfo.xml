  <Series>Heirs of Eternity</Series>
  <Summary>Music of the spheres, or the perfect order of art and science, rule our world. But what would you do if this music became discordant? If the cacophony of the cosmos shattered the thin veil of reality and rained the jagged shards of your whole world and all your preconceived notions of Heaven, Hell, good, evil and everything in between down on you, what would you have left?Â  Pyrus' mission strikes painfully close to home as Wayne is forced to rethink some of his rigid views of right and wrong. Meanwhile, heaven's newest Earthly agent guts the cities underworld in search of a little vengeance. Golgoth ties up a loose end and makes an ambitious leap toward his rightful place. If that wasn't enough, Yun shows his true colors. This issue is a must read!</Summary>
