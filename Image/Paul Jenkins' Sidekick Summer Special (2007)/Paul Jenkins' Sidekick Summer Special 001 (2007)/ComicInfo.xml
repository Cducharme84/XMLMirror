  <Series>Paul Jenkins' Sidekick Summer Special</Series>
  <Summary>Things we all know about summertime: snotty-nose kids are out of school, hot girls wear skimpy bikinis, video game geeks get fatter and sweat more—and Eddie Edison (a.k.a. Superior Boy) will continue his annual quest to be voted into the Council of American Superheroes (C.A.S.H. – a non-profit organization). He does this simply because he is sick of being Superior Boy and longs to be a real hero. Unfortunately for him, he is an idiot. Not only does his costume (and name) make him the laughing stock of the whole convention, but he stupidly "padded his resume" and stated that he had every superpower. This means loads of trouble for our hero. Okay, sidekick.

What does all this mean? If you’re lookin’ for a rockin’ good time (well, one that won’t require a round of antibiotics when you’re done), then don’t miss PAUL JENKINS’ SIDEKICK: SUPER SUMMER SIDEKICK SPECTACULAR #1! Did we mention it was written by PAUL JENKINS? You know, the guy that turned Wolverine into a wussie-boy?</Summary>
