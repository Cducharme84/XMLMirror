  <Summary>A short while later the last issue, WetWOrks received word that Mother One had been kidnapped and that as her ransom, Dan now needed to reassemble his surviving teammates from the original Team 7. Though rebuffed by Marc Slayton (aka Backlash), Dane did manage to capture John Lynch. WetWorks then boardeda robot plane with him in tow as instructed, which took off for an unknown site... Meanwhile, in New York City, Cole Cash (aka the Grifter), found himself attacked by a clearly evil Alicia Turner, who was also now calling herself Tanager. Giving chase on his bullet bike motorcycle, Grifter tailed her to the Castkill mountains and the aforementioned underground lab. There, ha was psychically assaulted, and his body was possessed by the former disembodied voice. Finally, WetWorks found themselves confronting their own new surprise as on board the plane, Mother One suddenly appeared from out the cockpit and declared that she no longer needed any of them... and that the plane could now be destroyed!</Summary>
