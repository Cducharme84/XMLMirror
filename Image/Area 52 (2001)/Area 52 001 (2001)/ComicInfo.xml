  <Summary>Imagine the warehouse from the end of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the place where the government stashes all of its other-worldly discoveries, from Excalibur to Alien ships. They are all to be found at Area 52. Think of it as Area 51's high-tech, remote, attic. When the government has sufficiently probed, poked, prodded and catalogued it goes here to gather dust... forgotten to the world... That is until something goes horribly wrong. Now it's fight or die-okay, maybe just hide at first--or maybe just die......That is until the base staff realize what they have been guarding in this remote high-tech warehouse wasn't just spare parts. AREA 52 is a fight for survival between an invincible alien killing machine and some poor shmucks... who just happened to be armed to the teeth with the most powerful, strange, and dangerous devices in human history!!! But the only problem for our people is... armed with what? What is it? What does it do? And where is the trigger? And how? Don't point that at me! How do we use this F&amp;*%$# thing!?! ...BEFORE WE ALL DIE??? This comic is a balls to the walls romp! Harkening back to the days when comics were action packed and fun... er, except for the first issue... sorry... had to set up that pesky character stuff! But the rest are slam bang... promise!Stylistically, think of AREA 52 as the love child of the best of Stan Lee and Warren Ellis. This comic features the stunning artistic talent of Clayton (Nine Rings of Wu-Tang) Henry. Top notch production and coloring by industry leader Haberlin Studios. And humble verse by Brian Haberlin, well known co-creator of Witchblade, Aria, Hellcop and Stone.</Summary>
