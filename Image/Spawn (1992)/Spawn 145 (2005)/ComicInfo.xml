  <Summary>His memories taken from him by Mammon, Al Simmons wanders the countryside hoping to find answers to a question he doesn't even remember. His trip takes him into a bizarre small town that seems to have a certain infatuation with the Devil. The architecture of the town has incorporated the Devil in some way or another: Stained-glass windows, mantles, handrails and doorknockers all contain undeniable Hellish motifs. Simmons comes across a poster for the town's Teind. Uncertain just what a Teind is, Simmons asks the local bed and breakfast owner Ruth about it. She tells him it is a festival that ensures that the town is surrounded by blessings and good fortune. She also explains the devilish d√©cor as a way to ensure that the town's folk are aware that evil is all around them. Simmons finds out the about the town's Teind, its hell-born architecture and the real reasons behind the town's beliefs as he attempts to rescue a little girl from being sacrificed and comes face to face with The Forgotten Ones.</Summary>
