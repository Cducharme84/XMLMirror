  <Summary>Al Simmons' death raised more questions than it answered -- especially for Jim Downing. After a long journey searching for an explanation to his extraordinary powers, Jim learns he is a true Spawn. With no recollection of his life prior to his coma, Jim is challenged with filling in the gaps to his jumbled past. While answers don't come easy, they DO come in this revelatory collection.

The issue starts with Sara asleep and the Redeemer in her room. He was about to kill Sara but he found a cross on her nightstand showing that she's a follower. So the Redeemer leaves a big cross on her nightstand. Then Jim meets a repoter who's been following Jim and he's brought a handicaped person with him. After a discussion he left. Later the reporter returned saying the handicaped man can walk again and that it was a miracle and the reporter wanted to write a story on it. Jim mad he told the reporter to FU#k off. Then Jim had a conversation with the clown talking about why they want Jim. Then the Redeemer came and swept Jim off the roof. Jim then turned into Spawn and broke free. The clown turned into it's true form and fought the Redeemer and won. The issue then ended with saying he trusts the Clown.</Summary>
