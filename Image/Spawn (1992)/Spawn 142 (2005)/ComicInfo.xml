  <Summary>Set free from the confines of Hell, The Redeemer spreads his wings and enjoys the open sky once more. Now that she has returned from her "rescue mission," Nyx releases Alâ€™s "shadow" from her control and collapses to the ground. In the hospital bed of Al Simmons, a miracle has occurred. Al, once in a complete coma, has been revived. The federal agents who have observed him since his admittance are not nearly enough to stop him. Al and his "shadow" have a couple of scores to settle. And they both plan to deal with the betrayal by Nyx with the utmost urgency. Suddenly remembering his oath to protect Nyx in exchange for his freedom, The Redeemer rushes back to her side. But with Spawn close to exacting his revenge, The Redeemer may be too late.</Summary>
