  <Series>Dynamo 5</Series>
  <Summary>Captain Dynamo, the greatest super-hero in the world, was not the most faithful husband. Now he's dead and his family is trying to piece together their lives. As his enemies descend on his unprotected city, Captain Dynamo's widow rounds up his five illegitimate children, each of whom have inherited one of their father's super-powers. Can these total strangers come to terms with their powers, their father's legacy and each other as total chaos erupts? This new ongoing monthly series as Image Comics chronicles a super-hero team like no other - Dynamo 5!

*Plot Summary*
Captain Dynamo is dead. His widow, Maddie Warner, discovers he's been unfaithful over the years, and some of his indiscretions have resulted in children. As Captain Dynamo's enemies descend on the defenseless Tower City, Maddie rounds up these five young adults and exposes them to the same radiation that gave Captain Dynamo his amazing powers, thus awakening their own abilities. These five strangers band together as Dynamo 5, and attempt to carry on their father's fight for justice, while coping with their new family ties.</Summary>
