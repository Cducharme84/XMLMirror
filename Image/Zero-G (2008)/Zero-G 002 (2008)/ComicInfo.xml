  <Summary>The international space to mine a mineral-rich asteroid comes to a grinding halt when their spaceship is sabotaged and they find themselves stranded. With no hope of being rescued and with the clock ticking on their oxygen supply, the U.S. team seeks out their Chinese counterparts on the other side of the asteroid, desperate to acquire parts to repair the crippled vessel. But on the way, they discover that they're not the only form of life on this space rock, and that the other residents are about to get their first taste of human meat. But our stalwart team gets a last-minute reprieve in the form of a helping hand from the strangest of allies.Meanwhile, our hero, Atom, discovers that the crystals they found in a cavern are not diamonds as they had assumed, but rather something far more powerful than any precious stone. And when Atom gets cut from one of the crystals, the effects on him are both awesome and mystifying. With action, mystery and horror all rolled into a tightly-wound package of science fiction at its best, ZERO G is a must-read, all-new, four-issue miniseries.</Summary>
