  <Series>Kabuki Agents</Series>
  <Summary>Issue one of the new ongoing series with new original stories of the Noh Operatives! "I've always planned on doing a series on each of the Noh agents that presents a personal view of their life from past to present, in the way I did with Kabuki in Circle of Blood. This Scarab series is the first of these," says writer David Mack. "And the events that occur in this story will have a huge impact on the current painted Kabuki series as well". Rick Mays, who drew Scarab in Masks of the Noh, is the artist of the SCARAB series. Rick has been working on it for the last two years so he has completely finished the art for the first storyline. This enables us to release the book Monthly, making this the first ever monthly series of brand new Kabuki! After the first Scarab storyline, Kabuki Agents will feature all new stories on Siamese, Tiger lily, Ice, and Snapdragon. This series chronicles all the adventures of the Noh agents that we didn't see in Masks of the Noh and the new Kabuki series, and it even guest stars Kabuki! And wait until you see how! In the Current Kabuki issues we learn that one of the Noh agents dies. This series reveals who!</Summary>
