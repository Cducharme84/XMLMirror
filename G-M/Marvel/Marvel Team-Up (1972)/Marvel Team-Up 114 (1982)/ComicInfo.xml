  <Summary>A group of young vigilantes called "The Young Watchers" had appeared on the streets of Harlem. But Spider-Man didn't trust them, and began a little investigating. Considering that Harlem was his turf, The Falcon was initially unhappy about it, but eventually decided to team up with him anyhow.

Before long, they discovered that the mastermind behind the phony vigilante group turned out to be Stone-Face, who was planning to utilize the heroic facade to cover his crime wave. Nevertheless, using a spider tracer, Spider-Man and Falcon successfully tracked him down to his hideout and put a stop to his deception. The issue ends with the two heroes discussing if vigilantism was acceptable for non-superpowered individuals.</Summary>
