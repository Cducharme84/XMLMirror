  <Summary>SynopsisWhat if everything you thought was funny about Deadpool&#8230;was actually just disturbing?

What if he decided to kill everyone and everything that makes up the Marvel Universe?

What if he actually pulled it off? Would that be FUN for you?

The Merc with a Mouth takes a turn for the twisted in a weekly horror comic like no other&#8230;

PlotThe book starts with Deadpool his killing heroes and villains alike. A  newscaster Trish Tilby, reviews the terror that has been going on since book 1 and we can see corpses of Ghost Rider, Doctor Doom and Howard the Duck. Trish stops to think and questions if anyone can stop him.

The scene changes to a fight with Spider-Man and Deadpool fighting above the streets of New York City. Spidey kicks Deadpool off of him and he crashes onto a police car. Deadpool heals quickly, gets up and walks over to Spider-Man. He pulls out his gun and shoots Spidey in the head.

Deadpool then walks away from the scene and the new voice tells him to take things slowly. Deadpool does not listen and decides to go for something huge. In the Avengers Mansion, the Avengers call a meeting and the current roster, including reserve members are as follows; Captain America, Ms. Marvel, Thor, Spider-Woman, Luke Cage, Wolverine and Iron Man. Jarvis runs into the room and tells them that Ant-Man is gone. He recalls him being in his labs worried about missing Pym Particles.

Wolverine sniffs the air. And tells the team that something bad is about to happen. Bombs grow to full size on the table along with the body of Hank Pym and the mansion explodes. Deadpool is among the rubble playing with Ant-Man&#8217;s helmet and kills Luke with bombs he snuck into the coffee and smashed Thor with an oversized Mj&#246;lnir he grew with the last batch of Pym Particles.

Deadpool then goes to the Grand Canyon where Hulk easily dismembers him. Hulk walks away into a cave and, while asleep, turns into Banner. Deadpool Cuts off his head. Later, family members of some of the fallen heroes hire Taskmaster to kill Deadpool.</Summary>
