  <Summary>Series finale! He pulls a knife, she pulls a gun. He sends one of hers to the hospital, she sends one of his to the morgue - THAT'S the Hit-Girl way. Mindy's had it up to HERE with that thing called 'restraint' and pays the mafia a long-overdue visit. Also: Red Mist faces his final super-villain training test. A limited edition variant by Bill Sienkiewicz will be released for this issue.

At the McCready house several of Ralphie Genovese's men have broken in and taken Mindy hostage, and they are threaten Marcus and his wife's life. But when Marcus and his wife unexpectedly fall asleep, from the drugs Mindy gave them earlier, Hit Girl takes charge. She kills the hire thugs, then on advise from her dead father's spirit, Hit Girl goes on a killing spree.

She kills 10 of Geovese's head lieutenants, then goes to Ryker's Island, where she kills Ralphie in his cell. Hit Girl then kills all the prisoners on Death row, to "Save the taxpayers a little cash."

back at the McCreedy house, Marcus takes the blame for killing the intruders. And Mindy learns how fragile her mother really is and hangs up her Hit Girl cape. She comments on how more Superheros are appearing each day.

In Asia at a Kung-Fu school Red Mist learns his "masters" are just taking his money and not teaching him anything, so he decides its too much work and will just hire a body guard.

One month later, Kick Ass is back to full health and after getting his ass kicked, Mindy agrees to train him.

Meanwhile in Eastern Europe at a dance club, Red Mist gets word that his henchmen have found him hire muscle and more importantly Red Mist them he remembers Kick Ass's name is David Lizewski.
