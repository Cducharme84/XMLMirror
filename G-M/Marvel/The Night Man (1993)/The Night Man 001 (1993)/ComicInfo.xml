  <Summary>Johnny Domino survives the car accident he suffered through and thanks the doctor who saved his life. When walking home from the hospital, Johnny Domino can hear a man's thoughts that indicate he wants to kill a woman. Alarmed, Johnny believes he may be going crazy because of the hunk of metal that is still embedded in his brain, but decides to investigate this man in case he isn't insane. He follows the man to a restaurant and overhears the man set up a date with the waitress there for the upcoming Saturday. Johnny leaves the area and rushes home to decide what to do where he comes into contact with two burglars. Donning a costume, Johnny Domino defeats the two burglars, proving to himself that he has what it takes to face a killer if he needs to. On that Saturday, Johnny visits the restaurant that the killer form the other day visited and tried to make a date with the same waitress, but she refused due to her prior commitment. However, she informs Johnny that her name is Ginger Robinson and that she is listed in the phone book. Johnny then leaves to visit his father before he goes to Ginger's house as Night Man, to prevent her from being killed. When he sees Ginger, he tries to warn her of the killer but finds that the killer's thoughts are coming from Ginger herself. It takes a few moments for Night Man to learn that the killer has already killed Ginger and has cut her face off, using it as a mask. The killer, now known as Deathmask, escapes on a boat and Night Man follows suit. They battle in the middle of the ocean, where blood that has dropped into the water attracts some sharks. Night Man pushes Deathmask into the water, presumably to his death. While Night Man ponders on a cape to keep himself warm, Deathmask's fist rises past the surface of the water.

In a back-up story, the origin of Rune is revealed.
