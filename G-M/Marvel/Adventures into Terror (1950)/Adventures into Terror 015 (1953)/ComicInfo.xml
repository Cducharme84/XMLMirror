  <Summary>The Woman Who Wasn't: In a wealthy land beneath Greece, descendants of Medusa deal with thieves by incorporating them into their snake-heads.

The Lion's Mouth: A lion-tamer hates his wife and so he trains the lion that he puts his head in to hate her too. His wife decides to get rid of him by sewing a picture of herself on the skullcap he wears when he puts his head in the lion's mouth.

He Kept Him in Stitches: A surgeon gets the chance to operate on a Communist overlord and leaves his scalpel inside of him near his heart so that when he recovers enough in two days to move, he will die.

Jaws of Death: When a bank-robber's partner runs out on him and leaves him behind for the police, his ghost fools the sap with false promises of stolen money hidden in the alligator pit into getting devoured.

The Tarantula!: A village is victimized by vampire tarantulas.
