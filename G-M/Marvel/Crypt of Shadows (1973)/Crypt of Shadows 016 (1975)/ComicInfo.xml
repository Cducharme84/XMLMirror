  <Summary>He Lurks in the Shadows: A killer wants to give up his gruesome trade but he loves his wife and wants to continue to give her expensive presents. He pulls one last job and resolves to tell her he's broke when he goes through a dark alley and feels a knife shoved deep into his back. It turns out his wife is in the same business for the same reason.

The Little Man Who Was There: Dennis Ames keeps seeing a strange little man just before some disaster happens that he narrowly escapes, and he eventually comes to realize that he can't escape forever, because the little man is Death.

Love Affair: A man and his secretary enjoy an affair in their shared dream, but when the girl's convict husband is released from prison and hunts her down, their dream becomes a nightmare when the husband shoots the man dead. In the waking world, the man's wife screams as he slumps over with a neat, round hole in his forehead.

He Died Screaming: A man doesn't want his daughter to learn where he keeps his money so he shuts himself in with it, only remembering too late that his hiding place is soundproof and airtight.
