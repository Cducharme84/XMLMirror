  <Summary>What Was the Staggering Secret of the 13th Floor: An oddly cheerful elevator operator is held at gunpoint with a passer-by by a spy planning to blow up the hotel. The elevator lets the spy off at the 13th floor, and while the passer-by is terrified, the elevator operator simply fades away, explaining that the bomb will never go off, since there is no 13th floor.

Reign of Fear: A man that has a handsome face on one side of his skull and an ugly face on the opposite side shows the ugly face to his robbery victims and his handsome face to the nearby apprehending police in order to be released. His crimes end when he is struck and killed by a patrol car.

I Dared to Look into the Beyond!: A scientist builds a time machine to travel into the future. He believes that he has travelled to the past, demonstrating that the future does not yet exist, but in fact he saw a future in which Earth was abandoned.

The Hog!: A reckless driver enjoys causing other cars to crash until his evil deeds catch up to him and he is a victim himself.
