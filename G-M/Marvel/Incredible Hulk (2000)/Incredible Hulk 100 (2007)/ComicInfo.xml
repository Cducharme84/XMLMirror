  <Summary>The World, My Jury!: On a runway at JFK Airport, Mr. Fantastic brings the Hulk down with his newly devised Nega-Gamma Gun. The Hulk is placed in heavy restraints and is put on trial for his crimes. After testimony in the case, both pro and con, Matt pulls a stunt out of his lawyer's bag of tricks and quickly proves that the Hulk is too mentally incompetent to stand trial. As the judge tries to figure out how to proceed, Reed shows up with his special gun and claims it will change the Hulk into Bruce Banner for good. Instead, it provides the Hulk with the strength to break free and escape.

But Who Will Judge the Hulk?: After his recent rampage in Washington D.C., the president sends Nick Fury and Cap to help Ross capture the Hulk. They are successful and prepare to transport Bruce to New York to stand trial. During the plane ride, Bruce's lawyer, Matt Murdock, finds him so heavily sedated that he is only able to wallow in guilt and prepare for death. Matt invokes Bruce's civil rights and demands that Ross give him a stimulant so he can talk to his client coherently. Ross reluctantly complies and Bruce quickly turns into the Hulk. Hulk bursts from the plane to find the FF waiting for him on the tarmac of JFK.

The Origin of the Hulk!: With the Hulk safely in the underground bunker, Rick dozes and thinks about his origins.

Planet Cho: Teen super-genius Amadeus Cho discovers that the Illuminati shot the Hulk into space and tells Reed Richards that the rocket didn't land where they had planned.

Planet Hulk Allegiance Part 1: As the battle with the Spikes continues, Miek's queen is infected and must be destroyed. Hiroim and Caiera decide to enlist the help of the Shadow Elders against the Emperor.
