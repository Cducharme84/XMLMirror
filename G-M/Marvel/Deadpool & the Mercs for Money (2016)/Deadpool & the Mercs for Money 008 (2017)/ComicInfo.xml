Now, Schaefer Theater- Deadpool just learned the Terrigen Mist had been transformed and is no longer deadly to Mutants, and he thinks Negasonic Teenage Warhead has something to do with it.

Five Years Later, Cambodia, the Secret Hideout of Negasonic and her protectors of Mutants:  Deadpool is talking to Negasonic alone, he tells her he knows she used her powers on the Terrogan Mist, and he want her to use her powers to change the past and bring  them back, but she doesn't want to.  Negasonic recalls all the war she's seen and she believes she did the right thing.

Meanwhile inside, Domino and her team are face to face with Negasonic's protectors, and tensions are running high.  Then as they seem to boil over, over who is right the Mutants or the Inhumans, Lash and a group of Inhumans teleport into the hideout, looking to punish Negasonic for defiling the Mists.  Machine Man realizes he was hacked by the Inhumans and its his fault they are there, and the this causes all three groups to fight.  

Deadpool leaves Negasonic to help his friends but is mortally wounded by Lash, and as he lays dieing he begs Negasonic one more time to change the past.  Seeing what she has done Negasonic uses her powers.

It turns out the Negasonic had used her power to look into the possible future in which she used her power to change the Terrigan Mists, and realizing the horrors it would incur she knows now not to use them.  Instead, she leaves Deadpool and the Mercs for Money, to protect Deadpool's daughter Ellie.</Summary>
