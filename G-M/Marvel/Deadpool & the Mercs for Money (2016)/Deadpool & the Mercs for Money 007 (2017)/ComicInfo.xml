Five years from now, in Limbo-town (formerly New York City), Domino, Machine Man, Gorilla Man, Ren Kimura and Deadpool are running from a group of Inhumans, who consists of Triton, Sheath, Inferno, Karnak and Lockjaw.  It's not long before they are cornered and forced to fight they way out.  

The fight draws the attention of some demons, and the two teams are forced to join forces and fight the demons. During the fight Domino and her team escape into the sewer, there they come across a beaten and bloody Masacre.  

He gives them a flash drive and dies.  Machine Man deduces that that the flash drive has the location of Negasonic Teenage Warhead, but unknown to him he had been hacked by the Inhumans and they are listening to everything the team is doing.

Then Present Day, Shcaefer Theatre, the newly formed Mercs for Money are deciding if they should help the Mutants or the Inhuman in the battle for the Terrigen Mists.  They come to the decision to help the Mutants, knowing many will die no matter which side wins.  This causes Negasonic to think and while alone in her room she uses her powers, to unknown effect.

Five Years Later, in the jungle somewhere, Domino's team has found Negasonic's secret hideout, where she is being protected by Polaris, Rachel Grey, Nightcrawler, Xorn, and Goldball.  Deadpool then takes Negasonic away to talk and ask her a favor, to bring back the Terrigan Mists.</Summary>
