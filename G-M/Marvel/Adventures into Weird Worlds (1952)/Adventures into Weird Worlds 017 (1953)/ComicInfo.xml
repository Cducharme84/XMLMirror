  <Summary>He Walks with a Ghost!: A thug inherits an estate that has a cemetery on it so he hires a steam shovel to dig it up. When the worker uncovers human remains, he runs away frightened. The thug gets up into the cab himself to disinter the remains, but grows weary with the work after awhile and sits down under a tree to sleep. He is woken by the sound of the steam shovel but is puzzled as to who could be driving it. It bears down upon him and just before the claw descends, he sees corpses through the cab window.

The Man from Mars!: A scientist who observes a flying saucer builds a device to establish contact with the Martians in order to ask them if he could go with them to Mars to avoid the likely atomic war on Earth. When a saucer lands and he gets to ask his question, the Martian laughs and shows him a picture of constant warfare on Mars. He says "We've been flying over Earth to see if we could settle here."

This Way Out: In a hospital prison ward a condemned killer's other occupant in the room tells him that there are no bars on the window. The killer attempts to escape through the window, but the other patient in the room turns out to be Death and the window looks into the execution chamber. The killer's heart gives out.

The Nightmare!: A woman relates her nightmare to her psychologist of living a very ordinary housewife routine. The last panel reveals she is a witch with an abnormal desire to live as a regular person seeking treatment from her warlock psychologist.

The Gentlemen of the Jury!: Gangster Nick Rico's lawyer keeps him out of jail in spite of many murders. But when Nick's girlfriend has had enough of his violent ways she turns to black magic to ensure that he finally gets convicted.
