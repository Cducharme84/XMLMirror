  <Summary>Change Is In the Air: John Blaze comes upon Kody fighting a creature just like him in the woods. He stops Kody from killing it and finds out that it was Kody's brother. His family has been tracking him and he disappears so that they won't kill any of his friends. Clara gets a vision that he is in danger in New York and she and John go after him. The rest of the group starts traveling again but Quinn stays behind trying to help Steel Wind. While Clara and John are in New York looking for Kody Clara kisses John. Kody sees this and attacks John because he loves Clara. John manages to convince Kody that there is nothing between he and Clara just before Kody's family attacks him again. Kody's father threatens to kill John and Clara but John and Kody fight together to defeat them. When Kody promises not to reveal their family secrets they agree to let him live but say that he is now an outcast and no longer a part of their family.
