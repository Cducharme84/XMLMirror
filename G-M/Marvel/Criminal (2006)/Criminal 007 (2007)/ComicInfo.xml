  <Summary>TRACY LAWLESS has returned from the wartorn deserts of the Middle East to find out who killed his brother, Rick, and why, but to do that, Tracy needs to find out exactly who his brother had become in the 15 years since he'd last seen him. First step -- finding a way onto the remnants of Rick's crew of heisters, and staging a high speed escape from a prison transport. Will Tracy fall back into the life of crime he was raised around, fall victim to Mallory, the woman who shared his brother's bed, or find his way to the truth? Hell, you'll have to read the damn book to find that out. From the acclaimed and award-winning team of Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips. And remember, every issue of Criminal is packed from cover to cover with content, from back-up stories to noir articles by Brubaker and many other big-name writers.</Summary>
