  <Summary>After putting Redditch in a coma, can Jack convince the scientist to allow him to try his formula to cure him of his lycanthropy?

LAPD LT. Victor Northrup and his team of officers has caught the Werewolf in a net. However, the beast grabs Northrup by the ankle and enmeshes the detective as well. He manages to fire a round at the Werewolf, but when the officers untangle Northrup, the Werewolf escapes. He follows the trail of DePrayve, and finds him menacing a couple. The Werewolf leaps upon the villain and their fight continues until DePrayve's "evil formula" wears off, and he reverts to Dr. Winston Ridditch. The man-beast slashes the scientist and runs off, leaving his victim unconscious, to later be found by Northrup.

Dawn arrives, and, after having passed out, Jack revives enough to drag himself to the home of his step-father Philip and sister Lissa. Elsewhere, Ridditch lies comatose in the hospital.

A month later, Ridditch has come out of his coma, and Jack and his friend Buck Cowan pay a visit. They explain they need a cure for a werewolf, and Ridditch's skepticism fades when he recalls the beast that slahed him. He agrees to let them try the formula.

It is dusk as the pair leave the hospital when they are confronted by Northrup who is there to question Ridditch. With the full moon soon to rise, Jack dodges the detective. Hiding in a dark alley, he becomes the Werewolf, whose roaming is soon interrupted when he finds himself swinging at the end of a rope wielded by the Hangman.</Summary>
