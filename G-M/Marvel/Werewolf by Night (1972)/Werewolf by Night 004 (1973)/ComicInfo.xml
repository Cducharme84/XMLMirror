  <Summary>Hunter Joshua Kane is out for the Werewolf!

On an abandoned movie studio backlot, big game hunter Joshua Kane stalks the Werewolf. The Werewolf leaps from the top of a saloon backdrop toward Kane, but the hunter fires a silver bullet into the man-beast's shoulder.

As the wounded Werewolf hides, the mind of Jack Russell within recalls the events leading to this point: the Werewolf carried Lissa, Jack's unconscious sister, from the chapel where they encountered Aelfric, into the woods. When she came to, Lissa's fright turned to compassion when she sensed Jack buried within the beast. The scene was interrupted by Joshua Kane who held Lissa at gunpoint, keeping the Werewolf at bay, until he reverted to Jack, who then passed out.

Jack came to in a room filled with dozens of hunting trophies Kane's home. Revealing Lissa unconscious in a chamber filled with sleeping gas, Kane forced Jack's alter ego to be the unwilling prey in a hunt.

The hunt continues. Twice, the Werewolf attempts to ambush the hunter, and twice Kane overpowers the wounded creature. Finally, as dawn approaches, Kane tracks him to an old, darkened film set, where a shadowy form speeds toward the hunter. Despite Kane's repeated gunshots, the thing, a prop stuffed grizzly propelled by the now human Jack, falls upon him crushing him to death.</Summary>
