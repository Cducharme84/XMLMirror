  <Summary>This Fatal Fury!: Loki rules Asgard. Thor is sentenced to death. He escapes his captors by transforming into Dr. Blake. He becomes Thor again and rescues Sif from becoming Loki’s bride. The Warriors Three wake Odin from the Odinsleep. The Odin-ring begins to take its toll on Loki’s well-being and he discards it. Odin appears and claims the ring. Odin banishes Loki and reclaims the throne, but, in his haste, it seems that Loki was mistakenly exiled to World’s End, a place from which he can engineer the destruction of the universe!

The Golden Apples!: The goddess Iduna is taking some golden apples to Odin as a gift. She is menaced by Fenris Wolf who is eventually driven away by Haakun the Hunter.
