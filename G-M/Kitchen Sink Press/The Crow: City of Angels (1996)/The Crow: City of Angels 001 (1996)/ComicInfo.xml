  <Summary>The story opens with a young cloaked woman holding a sword, clad in armor bearing wings. "I believe there's a place where the restless souls wander. Burdened by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter Heaven. And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain. In hope that somehow, someday, they will be reunited with the ones they love." explains the young woman as the scene skips to the past.   City of Angels - October 29th - La Noche De San Lucas.  A crow flies over as a gang has a man and his son bound on a dock facing the waterfront. As one of the gang members begins filming the ordeal, the father begs for his son's life. His pleas however fall upon deaf ears as his son is murdered. Immediately afterwords the man is shot 3 times by the de-facto leader, the two bodies are then dumped into the ocean. As the father and son sink to the bottom, the fathers dying view is of a crow, seemingly flying up through the depths and out into the night.</Summary>
