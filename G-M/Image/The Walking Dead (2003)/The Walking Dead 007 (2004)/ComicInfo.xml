  <Summary>We find out Lori slept with Shane when he was helping her get to Atlanta and they bury Shane next to Amy. They all pack and get ready to move them all away from the city. Using Dale's RV they head down the road where it is slow going due to the debris on the road.

As they attempt to move a car in the road during night fall they are met by a group of people who are almost mistaken for undead and shot. The group is made up of a middle aged Black man named Tyreese, traveling with his daughter Julie and her boyfriend Chris. Rick gives them some food and invites them to stay in the RV overnight with them. Tyreese declines and sleeps in his car. Lori is annoyed with Rick for trusting the group so quickly and the next day Tyreese explains that is the reason he had declined Rick's offer.

Tyreese tells Rick a story about what happen after the dead awoke, he said a old man he knew from his town attempted to rape Julie and Tyreese had killed him and was worried that something had changed him because he did not feel bad about doing it.

As they sit around the fire Lori walks a little ways off and as Rick comes to check on her she tells him she is pregnant.
