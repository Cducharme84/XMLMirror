  <Summary>The Story So Far... The mystery of The Gift continues as the Ancient One has chosen the latest bearer to receive one of his "gifts"â€”items with extraordinary powers that are given to normal everyday people Some have used them for good, while others have used them selfishly for their own twisted desires. But even others have used them for nothing more than survival. But even though these "gifts" seem to be given randomly... everything is not as it seems.

Last issue, a young group of teens suffer from a case of mistaken identity. Gunned down in cold blood by corrupt cops looking to make a come up, only one survives. Vanessa Gonzales flees for her life only to be confronted by the Ancient One... and his gift. Faced with a decision between life and death, she chooses to accept his gift... and her revenge. It is only after her fateful last stand that she sees the manipulation behind the Ancient One's actions and that he is no better than the men that killed her friends. The Ancient One once again continues his journey to find those that will receive his gifts.</Summary>
