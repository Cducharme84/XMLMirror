  <Summary>The saga continues as Alley has to come to terms with the death of her fiance and the symbiotic relationship she has with the leather suit crafted and possessed by the Marquis de Sade.

What is the connection between the Marquis de Sade and Alley Cat? Why was she led to the suit? What is the connection to a Satanist cult? Find out in the first chapter in the ongoing saga of Alley Cat!
