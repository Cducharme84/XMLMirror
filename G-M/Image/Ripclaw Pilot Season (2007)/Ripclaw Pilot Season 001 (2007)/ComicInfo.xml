  <Summary>Overview

Eisner nominated writer Jason Aaron (Scalped, The Other Side) joins up with artist Jorge Lucas (Incredible Hulk, Annihilation: Ronan) to unleash Top Cow's resident badass in the first of eight special one-shots published under the Pilot Season 2007 initiative. The killer team is joined by intense cover artist Tony Moore (The Walking Dead, Exterminators).

To kill the Yakuza kingpin called Boss Yamamoto, you'd have to fight your way through level after deadly level of his secret fortress, past an army of gun-toting thugs and sword-wielding assassins.  No one has ever been foolish enough to try.  Enter Ripclaw.  The fan-favorite character returns to the spotlight as dangerous as ever and fighting as if hell is at is his back.</Summary>
