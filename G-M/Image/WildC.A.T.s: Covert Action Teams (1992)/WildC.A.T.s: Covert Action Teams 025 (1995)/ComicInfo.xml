  <Series>WildC.A.T.s: Covert Action Teams</Series>
  <Summary>In light of last issue's events, Majestic begins to question if he made the right decision in sanctioning this new team of WildC.A.T.s. Is the next generation of heroes too violent for this traditional hero. When did the colors of black and white merge into shades of grey? "...as it is in Heaven!" Story by Alan Moore. Art by Travis Charest and Troy Hubbs. Meanwhile on Khera, when the team confronts Zealot, now going by her Khera name Zannah, and Marlowe, now going by Lord Emp, with the truth about the war and the planet's state of affairs they are shocked by the indifference they are met with. Can this truly be the end of the WildC.A.T.s.

Savant's WildC.A.T.s capture Slag, Attica and Deathtrap and hold them in their facility. Tao is able to use his computer knowledge to place their prisoners in a virtual reality program where they can be detained without any problems. Meanwhile, Hellstrike of Stormwatch learns that the new WildC.A.T.s have attacked H.A.R.M.'s funeral to captured Deathtrap and he gets upset, saying how Stormwatch was prepared to capture Deathtrap and his Mercs in a week. He rushes off in a drunk anger to attack the WildC.A.T.s and he realizes he bit off more than he can chew. Tao then gives Hellstrike a tracker to track down Deathtrap, who escaped during the melee. After the Stormwatch member leaves, Tao reveals to his teammates the the tracker was actually a tracer to keep tabs on Stormwatch. Meanwhile, on Khera, Voodoo, Void, Maul and Warblade realize that Emp and Zealot are too much embroiled in Kherubim politics and being treated like aristocrats to see any of the injustice on the planet. Emp and Zealot turn their back on their teammates and their teammates realize it is time to do something about their predicament.</Summary>
