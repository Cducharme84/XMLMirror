  <Summary>Overview

Driven to the edge by feverish dreams of doomed ancestors and vengeful spirits, a young architect searches for answers in the remote wilderness of Japan. What were the unspeakable crimes of his forefathers, crimes that hound him across the centuries? His quest seems to lead him to a mysterious bridge that spans worlds, and a doorway to unimaginable evil. Is he merely going mad or has he literally brought forth Hell on earth? In the end, only Spawn can know for sure. Part two of two.

Spoilers

Ben Nakadai is reluctantly visiting Japan, the land of his ancestors. In the ruins of an ancient temple, he discovers a golden box; a box that was left for him to find. Back at his hotel, Ben opens the cask. Meanwhile, Spawn can suddenly feel an uneasiness in the air, as ghosts begin to roam the streets and countryside. It is for Spawn to bring peace to these restless souls. Mykoto planned for Ben to find and open the golden box, and with that done, Ben himself is relegated to the spirit world. But in opening Mykoto's cask, Ben has also opened a door that will not soon be closed.</Summary>
