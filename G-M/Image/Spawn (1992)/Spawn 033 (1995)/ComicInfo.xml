  <Summary>The Violator waits below in the sewer system, preparing to deliver a message to his nemesis, one that won't soon be forgotten.

While this is going on Spawn warns his fellow bums that it is no longer safe to be around him, however Bobby reacts by telling him no matter what kind of freaks have shown up recently it's nothing different from the challenges they face every day.

Meanwhile Sam visits Twitch in the hospital, and though it appears Twitch has been badly broken, Sam realizes that Twitch feels a lot better than he looks, especially when his 7 kids come and visit him.

Finally Spawn makes his way to the sewer where an all out battle between him, and the violator break out. The violator curses Spawn, telling him what an honor it is to be chosen a hell spawn. Eventually the fight is put on hold when a water line explodes, sending our warriors literally up sh!ts creek.</Summary>
