  <Summary>Eddie and Andy were children with an abusive father. After listening to Spawn, Eddie took it upon himself to kill his father and end the abuse. (See Spawn #29.) Now, after serving many years in a juvenile home, Eddie is free and looking for the evil being that he feels encouraged him to commit murder. Meanwhile, Cog, who is dying, knows his time to teach Spawn is now extremely limited, but Spawn has his own plans for his own future, the future of mankind and the future of Hell. At the same time, Eddie, who found religion while incarcerated, goes on a shooting spree at the bus station where he is critically injured, as is his plan; however, not even death can dissuade him in his quest to kill Spawn. He is reborn. He is The Redeemer!</Summary>
