  <Summary>Flip-book issue.

Shares its pages with Stan Winston's "Realm of the Claw".

Trakk came into a world bathed in blood. He travels the scorched remains of the earth to find the Helmet of Kyldran, rumored to hold the very balance between good and evil. Others -- some not of this world -- seek its awesome power as well. On this ruined planet, hope is the most precious gift of all, and a timeless warrior can only be saved by the subtleties of his own humanity. Desolation and despair have become the currency of this new world, trumped only by mayhem and death. For the few survivors of the last great war, the once sprawling city now affectionately known as "the Pit" has become the center of activity. Alien and mutant warlords flood the streets selling their wares -- human cattle and wholesale slaughter. The Pit seems all but lost until the arrival of a stranger from across the Dune Seas. As a special added bonus the start of Realm of The Claw is also featured as a back up story, which introduces a world where ancient legends of Gods and Goddesses collide with that of our own.</Summary>
