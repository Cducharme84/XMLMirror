  <Series>Wetworks</Series>
  <Summary>WetWorks severed ties with their manipulative benefactor Armand Waering and were on a mission to investigate Pilgrim's wolf heritage. That mission led them to a village of werewolves, who were fascinated with Pilgrim's ability to control the frenzy well beyond childhood. During a ritual led by the village shaman, Pilgrim transformed into a wolf and fled into the forest. Simultaneously, the village was ambushed by Prince Drakken and his vampires, who had been planning an attack on their hated rivals for some time. With werewolves battling vampires, WetWorks was trapped in the middle and took on all comers. The appearance of Waering, the Jacquar of the wolves, stalled the vampire's attack leaving the village and WetWorks in disrepair. With Pilgrim back to normal and Grail injured in the fray, the team felt it best to leave the village and get on with their life without Waering.</Summary>
