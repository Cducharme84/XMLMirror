  <Series>Athena Inc. The Manhunter Project</Series>
  <Summary>Athena Inc., the blackest of black ops, has come up with the perfect operative. She can't be caught. And even if she could be, there is no way to link her to any action because she doesn't even know she's an agent. Heck, she doesn't even look like their agent. She was hailed as a success...that was until...the genetic trigger that enables her to switch personas began to break down. Now she can switch forms more or less on her own. And is now she's a threat to the security of Athena Inc. and must be dealt with. But who will deal with whom first? "Revelations", Gwen begins to realize what she is, and the realization is driving her #$%^&amp;*# crazy. She is losing it. But the warm hand of help is being offered by the cold heart of Athena Inc. itself, Morgan Castle. This guy is THE wolf in sheep's clothing. Mary knows he is not here to help. But how can she convince her na√Øve alter-ego that she is walking into a deathtrap, before it's too late? An issue not to be missed.
