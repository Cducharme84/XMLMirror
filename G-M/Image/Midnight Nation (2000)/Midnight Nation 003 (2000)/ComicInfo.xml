  <Summary>Laurel later explains that they must go to New York to get David&#8217;s soul back, and they&#8217;ll have to walk from L.A. Everyone else at the factory seems excited at the prospect of Laurel taking another on a walk. Laz joins them for a bit and explains in his own way with Laurel&#8217;s help that Laz is short for Lazarus who was brought back from the dead by Jesus Christ. Apparently Jesus had requested that Laz wait for his return once he was done having supper with his twelve friends. So Laz waited, and waited, and waited. Eventually he had found that he had fallen through the cracks and was the first to find the In-between.

They come to another cell of people who have become part of the In-between whose children were taken by the Walkers, David chooses to help get the children back and with Laurel and Laz&#8217;s help he does, during the struggle one of the Walkers recognizes Laurel and calls her by name. It gives Laurel hope for him. Laz stays behind as they continue to New York.</Summary>
