  <Series>Adrenalynn: Weapon of War</Series>
  <Summary>During the Cold War, the Russians were experimenting with creating the perfect covert weapon... a blend of strength, speed, killing power, stealth, and the human body. Project "Adrenalynn" was born. After sending many of these prototypes to the US for terrorist plots, they were ordered to shut themselves down and await retrieval. However, due to their extended inactivity, they began to "mutate" into half-monster, half-machine and are on the rampage! Sabina Nikoli (an unassuming teenage girl), is a better developed version of the project sent out on a search and destroy mission. The only problem is that when the job's done, the Russian organization that created her wants her dead as well! Featured in the pages of The Tenth, Adrenalynn is a Russian-built war machine, designed for speed and destruction. She jumps into her own series with a bang and is sure to leave fans wanting more!!!
