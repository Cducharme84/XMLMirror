  <Summary>Guest Appearance by The Darkness! Danielle Baptiste, the newest bearer of The Angelus, begins to explore what this new role means for her, learning what the Angelus truly is, and how it ties into our notions angels and even Heaven itself.

In the meantime at the place of the Angelus Warriors       Dani gets to know this world a little bit better.      Sabine enlightens her that she eventually has to confront the     Darkness. But Dani is not to happy about that since Jackie, the bearer of the Darkness, is a friend of hers. She eventually has to choose between her being the Angelus or Dani. The Angelus Warriors and her leader Sabine are not too happy about Dani having sympathies for the Darkness and the world of mankind. This is the time when Dani realizes that she totally forgot about    Finch whom she left alone in dark streets of   New Orleans. So she returns at the moment when Finch got rid of two thugs who wanted to rape her. Finch is able to defend herself and Dani in her Angelus form makes the thugs flee from them. At first Finch is mad at Dani but very fast they reconcile and Dani wants Finch to meet her father.
