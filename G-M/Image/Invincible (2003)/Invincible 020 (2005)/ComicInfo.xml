  <Summary>Mark Grayson is just like everyone else his age, except that his father is the most powerful superhero on the planet. And now he's begun to inherit his father's powers. It all sounds okay at first, but how do you follow in your father's footsteps when you know you will never live up to his standards? For nine years now (or however long it's been since issue #6 came out) readers have been wondering, "What's up with that robot zombie from issue #6?" Well, wonder no longer, because he's in this issue! Mark is on campus at his new college and something is amiss. What lurks behind...oh, wait: You already know!

Atom Eve decides to retire from the superhero business and use her powers to actually make a difference in the world. Amber gets mad at Mark when he mysteriously disappears to fight a Reaniman that is attacking the campus, she mistakenly thinks he ran off like a coward. If only she knew Mark is actually the brave superhero, Invincible. D. A. Sinclair formulates that his next Reaniman should be constructed from a...live subject!</Summary>
