It all sounds okay at first, but how do you follow in your father's footsteps when you know you will never live up to his standards? "Perfect Strangers," Part Three, The status quo becomes a thing of the past when Mark's world is torn apart before his eyes. How will he pick up the pieces? Events in this issue lead into our big issue 12 spectacular! Don't miss it!

Omni Man tells Mark the true story of Viltrum, and how they are an evil race who help the people who decide to be ruled by their empire and kill the people who don't. He explains that he was only on earth to someday enslave it, and although he had made friends and found love, and for a time he was happy he knew it would have to change. He even admits that he didn't love Deborah Grayson. Mark tries to deny the whole thing, and tells him that he doesn't give a damn about Viltrum, and he will not enslave his friends and family. Omni Man tries to calm him down, and tell him that he does not know what he is saying. Mark tells him he knows what he's saying and they begin to fight!</Summary>
