  <Title>Perfect Strangers, Part 1</Title>
  <Summary>Mark Grayson is just like most everyone else his age. He's a senior at a normal American high School. He has a crappy part time job after school and on weekends. He likes girls quite a bit. but doesn't quite understand them. He enjoys hanging out with his friends, and sleeping late on Saturdays. at least until the good cartoons come on. The only difference between Mark and everyone else is that his father is the most powerful superhero on the planet, and as of late, he seems to be inheriting his father's powers. Which sounds okay at first, but how do you follow in your father's footsteps when you know you will never live up to his standards? PERFECT STRANGERS PART ONE-Beginning of a brand new story arc, a perfect jumping-on point for new readers! Male bonding time! Mark teams up with former Teen Team member Rex Plode to thwart some evil, but how can the two effectively fight the bad guy when they really want to fight each other? Meanwhile events start to unfold that will lead up to the big issue 12 spectacular! If you've ever thought about picking up Invincible now is the time.

Tryouts for the new Guardians of the Globe. Also, the Mauler Twins resurrect The Immortal.</Summary>
