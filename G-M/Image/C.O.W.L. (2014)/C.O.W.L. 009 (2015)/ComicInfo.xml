  <Summary>Mayor Daley is under increased pressure to renew C.O.W.L.'s union contract due to the increased supervillain activity of recent days, especially Doppler's kidnapping of Alderman Hayes. Now Herbert Hoover is threatening to force his hand. Geoffrey Warner's plan is working.

Warner visits John Pierce's widow to see if she knows how and why he was killed. She doesn't let on that she has been working with Evelyn, from the Chicago Police. Evelyn later talks to her; they want to get Arclight to admit to what really happened.

Grant, Eclipse, Don, and Frank hang out at the target range. Grant wants to get back on the job. Meanwhile Blaze is investigating C.O.W.L. members to see who started the fire at City Hall a while ago. Pressure is on to find the hero who did it, and also to keep quiet about it at the same time.

Radia's boyfriend proposes. He wants to "take care of her," but Radia is tired of being taken care of and wants to take action. She's not interested in marriage.

Daley tries to get Warner to accept a contract, but now Warner is pushing for it to be even better than last time.

Radia, fed up with playing the passive woman, finds Doppler and violently takes him down, breaking the strike. She's "a superhero, dammit!"

This is the second issue to not feature a bio. It does have early plans for Doppler's costume, an in-memoriam photo of Joseph James Clark (friend of the creators), and a pin-up.</Summary>
