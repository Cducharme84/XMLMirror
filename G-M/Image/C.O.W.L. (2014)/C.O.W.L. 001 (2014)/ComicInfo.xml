  <Summary>Welcome to the “Chicago Organized Workers League”— the world’s first Super-Hero Labor Union! While C.O.W.L. once stood as a beacon of hope against an epidemic of organized crime and an unbeatable “brotherhood” of Super-Villains, the union now faces its fiercest foe yet—a disillusioned public. In targeting the last of the great villains, C.O.W.L. attempts to prove its value to the world and to each other, while staving off villainy from both outside and inside its offices.

Skylancer, the last of the villainous Chicago Six, tries to escape the pursuit of the city's C.O.W.L. agents.  They manage to kill him, ending the reign of terror that costumed criminals have held over Chicago.  However, with the Six gone, does the city need C.O.W.L., the union of superheroes, any more?

Their leader, the Grey Raven, makes the case to the public and a skeptical mayor Daley, and asks blonde bombshell Radia to do a publicity photoshoot for a men's magazine.

Meanwhile investigator John Pierce finds a tip on Skylancer's base.  He and some other agents check it out, and find a thug with Skylancer's tech.  They defeat him, but as they are leaving, Pierce notices some documents that seem to imply that Skylancer's tech actually came from C.O.W.L.  Meanwhile the agents (Eclipse and Grant Marlow) are feted for their heroics.
