  <Summary>Masquerading as a prisoner, Talon Moon returns to Earth with a mission that will determine the survival of the human race. To succeed he must survive an army of flesh-eating zombies and a well-armed enemy that knows his purpose.

Outnumbered and outmatched, Talon is "saved" by the man he hoped to find. Now a prisoner in a sexually-charged fortress, he learns the world inside is just as crazy as the one outside. He also learns there is more to his mission than he was told. 

Double-crossed at every turn, forced into unlikely alliances and unsure of his own sanity, Talon Moon must make decisions that will affect the future for all mankind.

Alone and running out of time, Talon Moon must free himself, save the world and escape from the dead!</Summary>
