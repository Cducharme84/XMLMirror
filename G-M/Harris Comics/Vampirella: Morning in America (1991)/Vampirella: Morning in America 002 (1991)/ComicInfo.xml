  <Summary>Chapter Eight: Swine Wine (That Which Brutalizes): Vampirella destroys Bane and releases the populace, including Adam and Pendragon, from his control. However, Chelsea is still being held captive by Shroud.

Chapter Seven: Sheep Wine (That Which Stupifies): Bane has summoned the populace to a political rally with his song where they are taken one by one by the night creatures as they succumb to his promises. Vampirella arrives just as Adam is about to be taken.

Chapter Six: Lion Wine (That Which Irritates): Vampirella looks for Chelsea, but Shroud has already taken her. Meanwhile, Bane's song has driven the populace in Washington D.C. to madness, turning people against each other.

Chapter Five: Monkey Wine (That Which Enlivens): Shroud had invented the serum that Vampirella used to curb her blood lust. But Shroud had cut off the supplies to make the serum. Desperate, Vampirella had turned to a drug that caused her to lose her memories and transform into the elderly Ella Normandy. Restored by her attack on Toomey's gang, Vampirella learns from Adam that his father is dead and she has failed to keep her promise to protect him. Meanwhile, Shroud sacrifices Toomey to bring forth Bane.
