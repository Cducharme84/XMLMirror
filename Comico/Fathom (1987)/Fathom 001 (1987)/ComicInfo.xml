  <Summary>Rebecca "Becky" Golden, the Elemental known as Fathom, receives word of her high school reunion. Golden excitedly informs her teammates, none of whom seem to care. Golden scolds them for their indifference, then storms out of the room. Golden arrives in style, to her reunion, only to be met by her old rival, Eileen. After exchanging cold pleasantries, and veiled barbs with Eileen, Golden is reunited with her best friends, Sue Willoughby and Amy Ingels. After a brief period of reminiscing, Willoughby and Ingels question Golden, regarding her transformation into Fathom.

Golden demonstrates her power, an act which terrifies Ingels, who flees. Willoughby demands an explanation. Golden recounts her origin .Golden, and Willoughby, were out on Puget Sound, when their boat, the Miranda, capsized. Golden struck her head, and drowned. Golden was resurrected by Aqua, a powerful Elemental spirit. Aqua bestowed the elemental power of water on Golden, and tasked her with vanquishing Lord Saker, a powerful sorcerer who had upset the balance of nature. Golden's fellow Elelmentals share a similar origin. The Elementals eventually triumphed over Lord Saker, but at a cost.

Lord Saker's Shadowspear, left uncontrolled, randomly raises new evil threats, that still require the Elementals' intervention. Golden gives Willoughby another demonstration of her powers. Willoughby, too, shuns Golden. Golden returns home, desperate for the comfort of her father, only to find Agent Porter Scott waiting for her. Scott informs Golden that her father is away on business. Scott informs Golden that Lawrence Cartajel, and Thomas Czuchra, have taken the Miranda out, for a week. Golden, as Fathom, catches up with the Miranda, and seeks her comfort from Cartajel, the Golden family's caretaker.

Cartajel soothes Fathom's wounded heart. Czuchra spots a distress flare, and asks Fathom to power the Miranda in the direction of the signal. There, they find a monstrous squid attacking a small sailing vessel, the Itagawa Maru. Czuchra renders assistance, as the Elemental known as Monolith. Before Fathom can act, she is struck unconscious by a flailing tentacle. Cartajel dives into the ocean to rescue the sailors, only to be attacked by sharks. Monolith battles the squid. Monolith wrenches a sailor from the squid's grasp, and hurls him into the sea, unaware of the closing sharks

. Monolith's battle with the squid sinks the Itagawa Maru. Monolith, as Czuchra, swims away from the sinking vessel, only to be attacked by sharks. To survive the shark attack, Czuchra becomes Monolith, and immediately sinks below the surface of the sea. Fathom recovers to find the Miranda being attacked by the squid. Fathom dispatches the squid, and the sharks. Fathom dives beneath the waves to retrieve Monolith. As the light fades with her ever deepening depth, Fathom begins to wonder if she will actually be able to find Monolith.</Summary>
