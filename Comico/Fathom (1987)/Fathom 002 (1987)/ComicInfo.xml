  <Summary>After being shunned by her best friends, at her high school reunion, Rebecca "Becky" Golden sought comfort from her caretaker, Lawrence Cartajel. Golden, Cartajel, and Thomas Czuchra, responded to a distress signal from a Japanese Trawler. During the course of the rescue, Czuchra, as the Elemental known as Monolith, sank to the bottom of the sea. Golden, as the Elemental known as Fathom, searched for Monolith. Fathom, though, found herself lost in the ever darkening depths. Fathom learns that, through an unorthodox use of her powers, she is able to see in the dark waters.

 Fathom's newfound ability to see in the depths, however, brings her no closer to finding Monolith. In frustration, and despair, Fathom cries out for help. Astonishingly, her cry is answered by a beautiful, golden-skinned, aquatic man. Fathom is powerfully drawn to the man, and succumbs to a brief romantic encounter. A strange sound draws the man away from her. Fathom tracks the golden man, by scent, to a strange underwater colony of fish men. Feigning godhood, Fathom persuades the fish men to take her to their medicine man, Kotatu.

Surprisingly, Fathom can understand Kotatu, who recognizes her as an Elemental Sea Spirit. Kotatu gives Fathom a tour of the city of Talmira, educating her on their way of life, and culture. Kotatu is certain Fathom has come to Talmira, tasked with some holy mission. Fathom, however, only seeks the golden man. When news of a demon approaching Talmira reaches them, Kotatu determines that vanquishing the demon is Fathom's true purpose. Fathom discovers that the demon has assumed the form of a monstrous, burning crab.

Fathom fights a losing battle against the horrific crustacean from Hell. After escaping the crushing grasp of it's claws, Fathom levitates the Hell crab on a pressure bubble, until it explodes in the shallower depths. All of Talmira celebrates Fathom's victory, showering her with gifts and accolades. Fathom demands to see the golden man. Kotatu ushers her into a hidden chamber. There, the corpse of the golden man hovers, suspended in an energy shield. Fathom angrily confronts Kotatu, only to be rendered unconscious.</Summary>
