  <Number>3</Number>
  <Volume>1987</Volume>
  <Summary>Fathom regains consciousness, snared in a net. Fathom easily escapes. Fathom angrily confronts Kotatu, the Medicine Man of Talmira. Kotatu assures Fathom that she is an honored guest, and not a prisoner. Fathom demands an explanation, regarding Maelstrom, the protector of Talmira. Fathom recounts her history with the Elementals, ending with the circumstances that brought her to Talmira. Kotatu explains that Maelstrom is long dead, and that only his spirit can be called upon, in times of great distress. Fathom defies Kotatu, and releases Maelstrom from his eternal slumber.

The citizens of Tamira rejoice at the return of the their champion. Fathom rejoices at the opportunity to spend more intimate time with Maelstrom. After one such coupling, Maelstrom tells his tale. Once upon a time, the Talmirans were human, living on the land. A rival tribe, the Senket, summoned K'Karge, a demon from Hell, to destroy the Talmirans. This upset in the natural order prompted the intervention of the four Elemental spirits. The water spirit, Aqua, was tasked with creating a champion for Talmira, one who could vanquish K'Karge.

The man who would become Maelstrom had been killed by a jealous rival, and left to rot  in a deep pool. Aqua resurrected him, and endowed him a portion of her power. Maelstrom, along with the Talmiran Medicine Man, imprisoned K'Karge. The cheifs of Talmira ordered Maelstrom to annihilate the Senket, an act which earned the wrath of the Elemental spirits. The Talmirans were cursed, becoming more fish than human, eventually establishing their community deep beneath the Pacific Ocean. Fathom garners the assistance of the Talmirans, and Maelstrom, in searching for her lost teammate, Monolith.

Over the next five days, Fathom finds herself distracted from the search, by both Talmiran festivities, and amorous encounters with Maelstrom. One such "festivity", however, fills Fathom with revulsion. Young Talmirans torture a giant squid, in a rite of manhood. Fathom is about to put an end to the cruel ritual, when a seaquake, and mocking laughter, herald the return of K'Karge. Using the inert body of Monolith, K'Karge has been able to batter away at his centuries long entombment. After dispatching a blood demon, in the shape of a monstrous crab, Fathom, and Maelstrom, attack K'Karge.

The battle goes poorly for Fathom, and Maelstrom, who are clearly outmatched by the powerful underworld beast. Seeing no other solution, Maelstrom sacrifices himself, swimming down K'Karge's throat, then exploding out from inside the demon, in a spray of blood and water. Fathom weeps over the dying Maelstrom. Kotatu tries to persuade Fathom into staying in Talmira. Fathom, though, is horrified when she learns that the Talmirans feast upon their own children. Fathom, with Monolith, returns to the surface world, where she takes comfort in the fact that "real" people are not cold-blooded monsters.</Summary>
