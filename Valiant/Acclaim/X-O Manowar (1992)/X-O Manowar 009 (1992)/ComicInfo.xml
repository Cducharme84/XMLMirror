  <Summary>Aric is returned to his own time and, with the power of the X-O armor at his command, he's determined to lay waste to the Roman Empire once and for all! But have his adventures in time and space changed him too much for his family, his love and his people to welcome this man returned with the power of a god?

Transported from the Lost Land by Solar's power, Aric finds himself back in his true home: Rome, 408 A.D.! Aric hurries to the camp of his uncle, Alaric, eager to rejoin his loved ones. But this man of god-like power isn't the Aric they remember! So great is their fear, that the Visigoths scheme with the hated Romans to kill Aric. The plot fails, but Aric knows this is no longer his home, and he buries himself in the armor, craving only oblivion.</Summary>
