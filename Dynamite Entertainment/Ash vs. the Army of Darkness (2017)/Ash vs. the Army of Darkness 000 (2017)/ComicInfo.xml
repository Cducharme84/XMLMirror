Ash recaps the events of Evil Dead 1 &amp; 2 and Army of Darkness for Ted Rainsford, the S-mart Human Resources, in an attempt to explain why he hadn't shown up for work for two weeks and why he shot a customer, 7 times.  Ted believes Ash, but fires him anyway from the job he's "had since High School."

Ash goes home depressed and unemployed, and is there when Joanne Wentworth, the Vice Princible of Alan Shepard High, knocks on his door.  Helen, the woman Ash shot at S-Mart, was the Librarian at the High School and was acting strange weeks before Ash shoot her, and now other teachers and students are acting strange too.  Joanne offers to pay Ash to act as a substitute teacher and  investigate the school.  Ash grudging excepts, needing the money and his car repaired by the school Auto Shop.
