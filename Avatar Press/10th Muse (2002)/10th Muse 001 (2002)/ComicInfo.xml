  <Summary>*The story so far....*
At long last, the 10th Muse has realized her legacy of being the exiled daughter of Greek Gods; she must spend her existence jumping from person to person, becoming "roommates" along with the souls of the bodies she co-exists with. In exchange, the person is granted the physical powers of the 10th Muse.

Most recently, the Muse has co-existed in the body of San Francisco District Attorney Emma Sonnet. However, in an effort to save the lives of her close friends Dawn and Brett, the Muse's soul was removed from Emma causing the Muse and Emma to become separate beings.

Powerless, Emma enlisted the help of the ruthless Medusa to defeat the Muse's greatest foe, her half brother Grayson Bishop. With the Hunter, Bishop was barely overpowered, but Medusa's attempt to kill the already defeated Bishop forced the Muse to deal justice and kill her.

Another casualty of the battle was Bishop's confidante Morgan who sacrificed herself to give the Muse the ability to survive with the body of Emma Sonnet. Now, the Muse and Emma are in separate bodies, joined in purpose but no longer merged as one.
