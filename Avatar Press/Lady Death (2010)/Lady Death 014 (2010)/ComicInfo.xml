  <Series>Lady Death</Series>
  <Summary>She was stripped of her power and battled for her life as she walked the Earth in search of her stolen memories. She was wrenched to another dimension to learn the shocking truth that her mother is the despicable villain who is responsible for her unending torment. Lady Death has been to hell and back, and now she is faced with her greatest challenge yet: As all eyes turn to her, does she have the confidence, or even the strength, to lead a rebellion which seems doomed to failure? Valora, The Fallen, Stigmata and representatives of the last remaining free tribes all want an answer, but will Lady Death choose her destiny before the betrayal of a trusted ally leads the magically super-charged Behemoth and his amassed army of the undead to their hidden base? Available with a Regular cover by artist Gabriel Andrade, a Wraparound cover by Matt Martin, a Sultry cover by Juan Jose Ryp and a retailer order incentive Art Deco cover by painter Michael Dipascale!</Summary>
