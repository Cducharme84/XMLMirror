  <Summary>Bailey Ross attended Destiny University, a school for students who were the subject of prophecies, until she was a teenager. Despite this, she never exhibited any magical prowess, as her prophecy proved to be non-mystical. She went on to become a professional competitive fighter, but she was ousted at the top of her career once the league discovered her magical education.

Now, she fights in MMMA: Mixed Magical Martial Arts, an underground organization that pairs magic with might. As the only non-magical fighter, Bailey is an anomaly.

This story takes place between Destiny, NY Volume Six and Volume Seven.</Summary>
