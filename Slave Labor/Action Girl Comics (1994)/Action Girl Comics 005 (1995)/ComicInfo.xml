  <Summary>Scary Biscuits: Six single-panel scenes of things that are scary - TV programs talking about fatal diseases for which you have the symptoms, mysterious buff-colored envelopes in the mail, store alarms that go off as you walk through with your purchases, medical procedures that require smear tests, late-night phone calls, and conversations that start with "I think we need to talk..."

The Indefatigable Gwen in "Marketing": Gwen and Ted walk through the Food Empire supermarket, complaining about the commercialism of movie tie-in cereals and the fake, wholsome-sounding names of products.  Suddenly they fall through a trap door in the floor, are swept along a conveyer belt, and eventually end up back in the supermarket, this time inside the frozen food case, as giant Old Santa Fe Man-Sized Burritos.

Straighten Up and Fly Right: Sal gives Fishead mystery pills he got free for being his supplier's best customer.  The pills cause Fishead to black out, when he wakes he doesn't recall what he's done - things like spray painting swastikas on walls or dressing as a KKK member.  Sal helps collect donations for Gus while Gus (dressed as Elvis) does a street performance of songs.  Sal's supplier is actually Hitler, who plans to achieve mind control through pharmaceuticals.  Fishead tries to explain to Sal, who sends Fishead off with Maggie, who is in a protest group of Hitler's next test subjects.

I Had a Lot on My Mind: A young woman recounts the story of how for four years during college she fed her hamster her leftover microwave Eventually she realized that she hadn't filled the hamster's water for a long time.  She found the hamster near death, but managed to revive him.  The day she graduated from college, though, her roommate's cat ate the hamster.

The Woman Who Was a Bird: A man with a young son marries a woman who is actually a bird who transforms herself into a person, but then sings a song to transform herself back into a bird while the man is at work.  The son discovers her secret and tells his father.  The next day the man sings the song to the woman, which causes her transformation back into a bird.  When the transformation is complete, the man shoots the bird.
