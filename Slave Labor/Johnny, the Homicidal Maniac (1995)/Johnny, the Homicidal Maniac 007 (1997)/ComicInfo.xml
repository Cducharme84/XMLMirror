  <Series>Johnny, the Homicidal Maniac</Series>
  <Summary>Johnny resolves to become emotionless like an insect. A copycat killer named Jimmy pays Johnny a visit and confesses to several murders, including one rape incident mentioned earlier to Johnny by Tess, which enrages Johnny so much that he eviscerates Jimmy with hooks and crushes his face with a sledgehammer. Afterwards, Johnny tries to phone Devi with a prerecorded message, but she delivers a diatribe against him. Johnny then argues with Reverend Meat, who urges him to give in to his emotions, though the disembodied voice of Nailbunny tells Johnny to resist. Johnny kills a beggar requesting money for beer by shooting an arrow into his back with a "kick me" sign attached. Johnny visits Squee and tells the boy that he will soon leave for a vacation, then smashes the back of Squee's father's head with a toy robot. The series ends with Johnny sitting on a cliff overlooking the city, writing in his diary
