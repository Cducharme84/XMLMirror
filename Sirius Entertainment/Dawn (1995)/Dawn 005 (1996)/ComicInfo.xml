  <Summary>Darrian is asleep on the subway train and is shaken awake. His instincts make him lash out with his sword, narrowly missing a cowering Adelle. She chats with him trying to reconcile their relationship while bringing up examples of her infidelity and even getting Darrian's name wrong. She fails to notice the halo he carries at all. She realizes it is hopeless and leaves the car only to be captured by a demon holding 3 halos.

The demon demands the halo in exchange for Adelle's life. Darrian refuses and instead attacks with his sword. The Demon turns on Adelle and as it slays her it is in turn slayed by Darrian. Darrian holds her as she dies.

He walks to the surface and calls down the angels who berate him for his angel killing. Demons arrive and the two armies form either side of Darrian, they don't even notice Darrian move to one side as their blood lust takes over and the two groups clash in bloody battle.

Suddenly a massive warrior appears head and shoulders over them all. An eyeless skull with twisting rams horns and massive single sided axe in hand it sweeps devastation through the ranks of angel and demon alike. Through the carnage the being strides up to Darrian and stares with light-filled eye sockets into his eyes.

The words "You killed them all" bring Darrian back to reality and a tear-less Dawn is there telling him he is stronger than them all, that was his reflection, that he is the horned god. He shakes her and her three tears run and form on her cheek.

She tells him they have lived like this before and she has been guiding him to this moment. They embrace and kiss.</Summary>
