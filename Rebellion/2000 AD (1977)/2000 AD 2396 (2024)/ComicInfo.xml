  <Summary>I am The Mighty Tharg, all-powerful alien editor of this circuit-shattering SF anthology! 

Welcome to the third bumper prog of the year, Terrans, where I add a little extra to your weekly Thrill-experience. Alongside the latest instalments of Judge Dredd, Rogue Trooper, Brink, Silver and Herne &amp; Shuck, you&#8217;ll find two scrotnig extra stories, complete this issue - Alan Kerr provides a timely Future Shock in Just Stop Evil, and James Peaty and Steve Roberts team up for All Aboard the Nova Express, a tale of struggling band The 400 Blows caught between an unscrupulous manager and intergalactic disaster!

It&#8217;s quite the week for excessive zarjazosity, as not only do you have this extra-sized prog but Meg 471 is out now too, and a whole lot is crammed into its 128 pages - you&#8217;ve got the final episodes of Dredd thriller Hive, Dreadnoughts, Armitage and Harrower Squad, plus there&#8217;s a Tale From the Black Museum from Cavan Scott and Luke Horsman. Add to that more Dept K and Pandora Perfect,chats with Mark Farmer, Paul McCaffrey and design droid G3M-A, and looks at the new volume of Scarred for Life and the latest incarnation of fanzine Zarjaz.

Enjoy, my Squaxx!

*Judge Dredd &#187; Machine Rule (Part 5)*
Mega-City One, 2146 AD. Home to over 200 million citizens, this urban hell is situated along the east coast of post-apocalyptic North America.

*Rogue Trooper &#187; Recon (Part 4)*
Nu Earth, site of a galactic war between the Norts and the Southers, where the atmosphere has been rendered poisonous. So the Southers created the Genetic Infantrymen, bred to be immune to the pollutants - G.I.s like ROGUE TROOPER, the last of his kind. Together with biochip buddies Helm, Gunnar and Bagman, they&#8217;re searching for the traitor that sold them out...

*all aboard the nova express (Part 1)*
COMPLETE THIS PROG! The 400 Blows are a band with a lot of intergalactic ambition but not much momentum. Taken under the wing of their shady manager Vox Ulterior, their contract sees them playing some of the worst dives in the quadrant. All lead singer Candy Darling wants is that big break - but together with fellow band members Slowbert, Zaireeka and Cans, it seems they&#8217;re going nowhere fast...

The late 21st century, and through environmental catastrophe and industrial overload Earth has been reduced to a wasteland. Mankind finally evacuated the planet in 2072 and millions were housed in a number of deep-space Habitats. But life on these cramped, overcrowded stations is tense, often spilling over into madness. Sects are rife, and Bridget Kurtis of the Habitat Security Division is investigating their reach...
