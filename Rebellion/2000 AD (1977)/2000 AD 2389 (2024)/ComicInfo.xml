  <Summary>I am The Mighty Tharg, cosmic source for all that is zarjaz - join me on a galactic journey! 

We slip into July, and as we become fully embedded in the holiday season it&#8217;s fitting that this week sees the release of 2024&#8217;s 2000 AD Sci-Fi Special, a self-contained 48-page issue that&#8217;s the ideal accompaniment to your vacation travels, which features some of your favourite characters from the pages of the GGC. Or does it&#8230;?

For this year&#8217;s summer special has some rather unusual variations on the standard line-up, plucked from an alternate reality when the strips fell through a nearby interdimensional wormhole. In that universe, top cop in MC-1 is Judge Alpha, a mutant given Special Dispensation to enforce the law; alongside him you&#8217;ll find the Robo-Sharks, a pair of stone-cold guns-for-hire that hunt missing or malfunctioning droids, undead aeroball team the Harlem Zombos, dread pirate captain Stickleback, and wanted Search/Destroy agent Friday otherwise known as the Rogue/Dog. 

It&#8217;s the mash-up to end all mash-ups - don&#8217;t miss it! Meanwhile, this prog contains the double-length final episode of the Proteus Vex saga - an alien extravaganza unlike any other!

*Judge Dredd &#187; The Bam-Hunters (Part 1)*
Mega-City One, 2146 AD. Home to over 200 million citizens, this urban hell is situated along the east coast of post-apocalyptic North America, with the irradiated Cursed Earth to the west and the toxic Black Atlantic on the eastern side. Crime is rampant, and only future cops the Judges - empowered to dispense instant justice - can stop total anarchy. Toughest of them all is JUDGE DREDD - he is the Law!

*Brink &#187; Consumed (Part 12)*
The late 21st century, and through environmental catastrophe and industrial overload Earth has been reduced to a wasteland. Mankind finally evacuated the planet in 2072 and millions were housed in a number of deep-space Habitats. But life on these cramped, overcrowded stations is tense, often spilling over into madness. Sects are rife, and Bridget Kurtis of the Habitat Security Division is investigating their reach...

*Rogue Trooper &#187; Souther Belle (Part 4)*
Nu Earth, site of a galactic war between the Norts and the Southers, where use of chemical weapons has rendered the atmosphere poisonous. So the Southers created the Genetic Infantrymen, bred to be immune to the planet&#8217;s pollutants - G.I.s like ROGUE TROOPER, the last of his kind. Together with biochip buddies Helm, Gunnar and Bagman, they&#8217;re searching for the traitor that sold them out...

*PROTEUS VEX &#187; Devious (Part 15)*
The far future. The centuries-long war between the Alliance and the Obdurate people is over, a conflict ended when the Alliance teleported a dying white dwarf star into the Obdurate system. Imperium agent PROTEUS VEX - who is operated by a flesh-pilot - became an enemy of the Alliance when he released info about past war crimes. In the wake of the war with the Scorchers, Vex is missing, presumed dead...</Summary>
