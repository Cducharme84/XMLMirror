	<Summary>I am The Mighty Tharg, a cosmic being from Betelgeuse with the awesome power to Thrill!

You know, a question many of your species has pondered over the last few years has been to do with the nature of reality - or, more pertinently, is what you’re witnessing actually what it purports to be? Yes, I’m talking about Is it Cake?, a televisual journey into existentialism that asks you - can you truly rely on your senses that you’ve used to navigate this world since birth? Or are you being fooled, and notions of what you thought was real can easily be undone? Is that really a shoe? A handbag? A bowl of fruit? Or is it just cake?

It’s something I mull over here in the Command Module in this age of manipulated reality - replace cake with artificial intelligence and it becomes more sinister. Do I hold in my hand something that was created by a single imagination, or a code inputted into a program? Is it what it claims to be, or an approximation of a creative endeavour? A computerised recreation of artistry?

Needless to say, nothing but pure zarjaz creativity here in these pages, with the return of Aquila and the finale to Full Tilt Boogie. Be here in seven for the start for Brink Book Six, humes!

*Judge Death » Rend &amp; Tear with Tooth &amp; Claw (Part 2)*
Mega-City One, 2146 AD. Home to over 200 million citizens, this urban hell is situated along the east coast of post-apocalyptic North America, with the toxic Black Atlantic to the east and the irradiated Cursed Earth to the west. Crime is rampant, and only future cops the Judges - empowered to dispense instant justice - can stop total anarchy. Toughest of them all is JUDGE DREDD - he is the Law!

*Full Tilt Boogie » Full Tilt Boogie: Book two(Part 11)*
Out in the deep reaches of the cosmos, teenager Tee - together with her grandmother and cat - is a bounty hunter/hired help, operating from her spaceship the FULL TILT BOOGIE. Capable and resourceful, Tee was paid to rescue the Luxine Prince Ifan from his debtors’ prison. In the process, she encountered a resurrected Anubite warrior, a member of the enemy race with whom the Luxine Empire was at war...

*Aquila » The Rivers of Hades, Book Two: PART 1 (Part 1)*
Following Spartacus’s failed revolt against his Roman masters, his rebel army was crucified. Amongst these was the slave-turned-gladiator AQUILA, who cried out to the gods for vengeance - and was answered by Ammit the Devourer, a deity that gifted him with immortality in return for keeping her fed with evil men’s souls. Now, Aquila has travelled into Hades and retrieved the spirit of Nero, who knows Ammit’s location...

*Indigo Prime » Black Monday (Part 7)*
The multiverse. There is an infinite number of parallel realities, and all need managing in case of dimensional instability. This is where INDIGO PRIME came in, the multiverse’s troubleshooters, whose agents are trained to deal with space/time catastrophes. Now, IP’s HQ has been destroyed in a cataclysmic event, with most of the personnel lost, and its assets acquired by the company ICP...

*PROTEUS VEX » Devious (Part 3)*
The far future. The centuries-long war between the Alliance and the Obdurate people is over, a conflict ended when the Alliance teleported a dying white dwarf star into the Obdurate system.
