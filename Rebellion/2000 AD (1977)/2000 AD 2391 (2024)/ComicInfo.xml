  <Summary>Witness my works with awe-inspiring wonder, for I am The Mighty Tharg, purveyor of Thrills!

I dictate these words to my desktop minion the day before the UK goes to the polls. Will it be, as has been predicted, an electoral wipeout for the sitting government? By the time you read this, we&#8217;ll know for sure - but what is cast-iron guaranteed is that you&#8217;ll have a scrotnig time with this prog. Inside, you&#8217;ll find the final episodes of both The Bam-Hunters and Souther Belle, the latest instalments of Brinkand Silver, plus a complete Future Shock from James Peaty and debuting art-droid Sedat Oezgen!

As mentioned last issue, this week sees not only the release of an all-new Misty special as US writer Gail Simone and a trio of artists craft some chilling short tales, but also Judge Dredd Megazine470, with a brand-new case for the lawman in Hive by Ian Edginton and Kevin West, plus another complete Mega-City 2099 story from the Niemand and Foster droids, alongside Armitage, Dreadnoughts, Harrower Squad, Dept K and Pandora Perfect. Add to that interviews and features too, and it really is an utter monster!

Grab &#8216;em now, Terrans - your diodes demand it!

*Judge Dredd &#187; The Bam-Hunters (Part 3)*
Mega-City One, 2146 AD. Home to over 200 million citizens, this urban hell is situated along the east coast of post-apocalyptic North America.

Now, a powerful mage has travelled from Cal-Hab to MC-1, hunting down a pair of necromancers...

*Brink &#187; Consumed (Part 14)*
The late 21st century, and through environmental catastrophe and industrial overload Earth has been reduced to a wasteland. Mankind finally evacuated the planet in 2072 and millions were housed in a number of deep-space Habitats. But life on these cramped, overcrowded stations is tense, often spilling over into madness. Sects are rife, and Bridget Kurtis of the Habitat Security Division is investigating their reach...

*Rogue Trooper &#187; Souther Belle (Part 6)*
Nu Earth, site of a galactic war between the Norts and the Southers, where use of chemical weapons has rendered the atmosphere poisonous. So the Southers created the Genetic Infantrymen, bred to be immune to the planet&#8217;s pollutants - G.I.s like ROGUE TROOPER, the last of his kind. Together with biochip buddies Helm, Gunnar and Bagman, they&#8217;re searching for the traitor that sold them out...

*Tharg's Future Shocks &#187; Crescendo (Part 1)*
Out in the vast reaches of the universe, there are an infinite number of stories waiting to be told.
