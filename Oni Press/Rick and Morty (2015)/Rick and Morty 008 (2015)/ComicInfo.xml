SynopsisRick and Morty are in the Blumbus Dimension. Rick hates the idea while Morty enjoys the nuanced differences between Blumbus and Christmas. The two part: Rick is off to find a bar while Morty hangs around the town to enjoy the holiday.

Morty tries to convince himself that Mr. Chimney is not a creepy replacement for Santa Claus but freaks out when what he thought was a stature winks at him. Morty runs headlong into a girl, Melody, that invites him home for Blumbus. Morty feels incredibly awkward about this, especially when he learns that Melody's family thought she was killed at war, but eventually buys in to being in their home.

Rick has found a bar and watches the dimensions version of "A Christmas Carol", in which Mini Mike goes to the store for Mr. Frooge to get a blumberflarg, which ends up being a lost teenage boy. Rick realizes that Morty is dumb enough to be picked up as a family's potential blumberflarg and runs out of the bar.

At Melody's house, Melody begins the blumberflarg ritual by trying to seduce Morty, who is becoming increasingly wary of the situation. Melody's mom interrupts and drops that Morty will soon be cooked, which freaks him out. Morty tries to escape but is held back by the family. Mr. Chimney shows up with Rick and blasts Melody's family into dust and explains that Morty has been a good boy and does not deserve to die. Mr. Chimney then describes in detail things in Morty's room. This shocks Rick, as Mr. Chimney is apparently a god that can see inter-dimensionally, and Rick tries to knock out Mr. Chimney as the two run away.

Later that night, Rick and Morty watch the Blumbus version of "It's a Wonderful Life". Morty leaves when the blumberflarg is shown. Rick berates him but is then approached by a ghost of some guy who warns him of a visit by three ghosts. Rick has a quick Scroogeian trip and begs to go back - which is granted - so he can watch the rest of the show.
