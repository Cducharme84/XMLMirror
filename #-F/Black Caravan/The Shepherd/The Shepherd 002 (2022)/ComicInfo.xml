  <Summary>Great jumping in point for new readers. Professor Lawrence Miller lost his son Val to a drug overdose. Recklessly, Miller followed his son into the afterlife. After great turmoil and with the help of Franco, his long-deceased father, Lawrence and Val are reunited. Now they wander the "Seam," that ever-shifting place between this world and whatever comes next, choosing to spend their eternity helping other souls. Now, the Millers happen upon a "hospital" for souls who have died in combat. Here warriors of all cultures and eras gather and their souls are still fighting the battles that claimed their lives. Can the Millers survive and help these miserable spirits or will they be swept into the cycles of violence that haunt this place?</Summary>
