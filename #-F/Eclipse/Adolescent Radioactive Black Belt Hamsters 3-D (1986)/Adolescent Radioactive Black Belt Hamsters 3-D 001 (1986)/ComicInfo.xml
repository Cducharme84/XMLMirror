  <Series>Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters 3-D</Series>
  <Summary>The hamsters are playing video games in an arcade when they run afoul of a bully. They get in a fight and eventually Chuck beats him. A professional wresting agent, Vincent DeLuxe, sees them fight and asks them to wrestle for him. He thinks they're in hamster costumes.

He offers them $25,000 each, and they agree immediately. They start to train and get ready for their match against their foes, the Mighty Midgets (four dwarves from Snow White). They run the talk show circuit and become instant celebrities in the run up to the fight. Little do they know that DeLuxe has told the midgets to take a fall, and has bet millions on the hamsters.

However, the Mighty Midgets can't get to the rung because their flight has been delayed. DeLuxe hires four major bruisers to take their place, but forgets to tell them to lose, so now he and the hamsters are in serious trouble. However, the hamsters manage to beat their new opponents in the end.

DeLuxe wins his money, and gives each of the hamsters wins $5 million. Chuck gives his to charity, Jackie buys a toy store, Bruce buys cars, and Clint buys a nuclear missle!

Note: Unlike the main Hamsters title, the 3D stories are mainly straight action-comedy, and not so self-aware of themselves as comic books.</Summary>
