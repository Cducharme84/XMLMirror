  <Series>Zot!</Series>
  <Number>14&#189;</Number>
  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>This issue takes place entirely in Dimension 10 1/2, with the exception of a single page at the end showing Zot, still sleeping inside Zybox.

Antisocialman causes chaos by forcing people to work or go to school when they don't need to.

Jenny and Butch get some members of Cynicalman's fan club to help find Cynicalman, Antisocialman's enemy. They travel around various realities. When they return to Dimension 10 1/2, Butch turns into a monkey and Jenny turns Antisocial.

Josh, Digger, and Vic start working against Antisocialman as well. They meet up with Jenny and the others. They go to Max's but he's not there. They keep planning how to defeat Antisocialman.

Zot, who was turned into Antisocialman's ally, helps him cause chaos.

The friends learn more about Dr. Pweent, who is behind some of Antisocialman's plans, and they formulate an anti-antisocial spray. They cure Jenny. They try to cure Zot but he zaps their spray guns. However they manage to cure him with pies, infused with the antidote, that they throw in his face.

Max comes home and everyone dances. Antisocialman feels left out. He brings in many of Zot's enemies. The heroes defeat them. Zot says he'll be friends with Antisocialman if that helps, but Antisocialman tricks him by shaking hands with boogers on his hands.

Antisocialman lets Pweent out of a bottle that he was trapped in, but the heroes knock them both into another dimension.</Summary>
