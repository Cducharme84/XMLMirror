  <Title>Can't Buy Me Love Pt.2; The Adventures of Zot! in Dimension 10 &#189; 22</Title>
  <Series>Zot!</Series>
  <Number>22</Number>
  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>Woody is depressed about his chances with Jenny now that he knows the truth about Zot. He's conflicted because he actually liked Zot when he briefly met him.

Jenny and Terry drive past Woody on their way back from the beach. Jenny gets out to talk with him. Terry tells her parents she thinks Woody is a nerd but her dad mentions that Woody's dad made some tough ethical decisions as an ambassador and he might be worthy of respect.

Back in Zot's universe, the Blotch flies around bragging about how Zot is now one of his supporters, and Zot can't say anything because of his contract with Bingo Pop.

Jenny tells Woody she's hurt that Zot hasn't said he loves her, but Woody says he sort of said that to him when he (Woody) told Zot that he loved Jenny. Jenny is excited to hear about what Zot said and then only afterward realizes what Woody said. But then she realizes she's not sure if she actually loves Zot.

Zot has a plan to get around his contract. He has a mini camera record the Blotch confessing, then has Peabody send that to the police, meaning Zot never disparaged him himself.

They go to catch the Blotch, even if that might break the contract. They take the Blotch's dimension door to the planet where he lives, a super-commercialized world. They fight off various flunkies.

The Blotch realizes he was being recorded and reduces one of his lieutenant's bank accounts to only $7 in retaliation. Zot breaks in and grabs the formula to Comet Cola that was stolen last issue. The criminals give chase but they trick him into going through the dimensional door, the other side of which now leads to jail.

Jenny confronts Zot about whether he loves her. He says yes, in the general sense that he feels love for anyone, but that he doesn't know what it really means, because it can imply that you feel a sense of ownership over someone. Jenny admits she doesn't know if she loves him either. They decide they're ok.

Zot shows her a new ad he shot, where he admits he's ambivalent about Bingo Pop. He is giving the money to charity. She likes it.

In "The Adventures of Zot in Dimension 10 &#189;!," Zot and Jenny see a cat die when it falls out of a tree. They keep trying to figure out what to do with the body. Jenny leaves Zot and he gets sick and almost dies from a tornado. Then he wakes up and realizes it was a dream from reading Yummy Fur before going to sleep.</Summary>
