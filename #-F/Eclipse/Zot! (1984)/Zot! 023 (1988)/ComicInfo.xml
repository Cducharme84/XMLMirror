  <Title>The Ghost In The Machine, Part 1; The Big Adventures of Zot! in "Dimension 10 &#189;"</Title>
  <Series>Zot!</Series>
  <Number>23</Number>
  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>9-Jack-9 walks Jenny's Earth in search of a target, causing minor chaos as he goes.

Jenny and Butch prepare to eat dinner and talk to their absent mom on the phone. Jenny sees Jack's reflection in the microwave screen. She freaks out and has Butch turn off all the circuit breakers in the house so Jack can't come in over the electric circuits. Zot arrives and Jenny tells him about Jack.

Woody plays a role-playing game he invented with some friends: Ronnie, Elizabeth, Bob/Spike, and George. The game uses characters from mainstream comics, but put in ridiculous situations, like confronting Mayor McCheese. Woody is reminded that he has a date with Jenny and he rushes off.

George goes with him and says he has been neglecting the game recently. Woody admits that it's because his mind was blown by seeing the reality of Zot's world; now he has a hard time even caring about fantasy, let alone competing with Zot for Jenny.

When they get to Jenny's, Woody is angry that Zot is there when this is supposed to be his time with her. Jenny says she has to go with Zot because of the danger. At first Woody doesn't believe her but eventually he does.

Zot and Jenny fly to meet Max. They are being very careful not to have any electric devices. Max shows them a portal that can take them to both Jenny's Earth and to the planet Antares. There, a military coup took over 2 years ago. 9-Jack-9 helped the coup by killing the family of the president. Only their young girl escaped. She has been living in Jenny's Earth to stay safe. Now, Jack is after her.

The resistance on Antares wants her back as a symbol of freedom. Zot is sent to get her. He goes through the portal and brings her back, but she has lost all hope and doesn't really want to help.

They notice that Susan, the girl, has a watch, so Zot has to take ot off and destroy it, even though it was a gift, presumably from her family.

However, Jack takes over the portal, even though it was supposed to be off. He reaches through and grabs Susan. Zot and Jenny follow before the portal shuts off.

Starting in this issue, Matt Feazell's back-up stick-figure strip expands to 6 pages. Zot and Cynicalman change minds due to an experimental screw-up. Zot cleans Cynicalman's room. Zot's friends think Cynicalman (who looks like Zot) is amnesiac and take him to a doctor. Zot does more chores and helps people out, to their surprise. Cynicalman, meanwhile, does try to help people too, but causes chaos in the process. Eventually Max is able to return them to normal.</Summary>
