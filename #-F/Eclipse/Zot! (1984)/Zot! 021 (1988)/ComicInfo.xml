  <Title>Can't Buy Me Love Pt.1; The Adventures of Zot! in Dimension 10 &#189; 21</Title>
  <Series>Zot!</Series>
  <Number>21</Number>
  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>Zot catches two cartoonish bank robbers, then drinks a Bingo Pop soda to refresh himself. We realize this is not reality, but an ad where Zot has become a Bingo Pop spokesperson.

Zot shows the ad to his friends, who all like it except for Vic. He sees how crass it is, and how naive Zot is about it. He knows Jenny will hate it and tells Zot that. Zot doesn't understand why.

Jenny is working at a convenience store because her dad wants her to get a work ethic. She hates it. Woody comes in and makes a date with her.

They take a bus to a college town, possibly Boston. They have some Bertucci's pizza, ice cream, and watch street performers. When Woody drops her off at home, Jenny lets Woody know that she does care about him, but she is conflicted because of Zot. Woody is elated and walks away, but bumps into Zot.

He looks into Zot's portal and sees his Earth. He is amazed and can't understand how he could compete with Zot. However, he stands up for himself and tells Zot he loves Jenny. Zot is fine with that; he says he doesn't own Jenny and she makes her own decisions.

Zot, Jenny, and some others are flying around in his dimension when they see the Blotch, who Zot put in jail a while ago. The Blotch explains that he got out by transferring to a jail where you can pay your way out, and he's rich. Zot is angry.

They get reports that someone is stealing the formula to Comet Cola. They chase them, and Zot starts to fight the crooks, but while doing so, Jenny happens to see Zot's Bingo Pop ad. She gets out and interrupts Zot while he's fighting to tell him how awful the ad is.

The crooks get away but they track them to the Bingo Pop headquarters. They find out that the Blotch has taken over the company. Zot didn't realize that his ad contract had a clause where he can't disparage them, including the boss, the Blotch.

In "The Adventures of Zot in Dimension 10 &#189;!," Max accidentally sends Zot and Jenny to a dimension that is blank like a sheet of paper. They draw in some scenery but are then visited by Dekko, who freaks out and erases it all. They escape to Jenny's universe and lock Dekko in the blank one.

This issue is also notable because prolific letter writer, T.M. Maple, reveals his real name for the first time: Jim Burke.</Summary>
