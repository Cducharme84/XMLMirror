  <Title>Art And Soul, Part 1</Title>
  <Series>Zot!</Series>
  <Number>3</Number>
  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>Zot and Jenny discuss what to do with the Golden Key--they know it's not theirs but feel like maybe they should hold onto it. Jenny continues to wish she could stay in Zot's utopian world forever, feeling that her parents would never miss her, and Zot keeps avoiding talking about his parents.

Meanwhile, a set of missile-like robots are launched out of silos in Antarctica.

Zot's friend Chris shows up, asking if Zot has seen Chris's bother, Vic, who is one of Zot's best friends. He disappeared on a visit to Sirius IV.

Vic slips in the house right after Chris leaves. He's been on the run for days.

Uncle Max gives Butch a special tech-belt with a heat beam, force field, and emergency call button in case he gets in danger as a chimp. He's close to figuring out how to reverse his condition and in the meantime plays melodies on a flute from Sirius, to Jenny's delight.

Vic explains that he was the original thief who stole the key, and also the disguised figure in the virtual reality game earlier. Their friend Josh Hacker had built a device, called Floyd, that could hide someone from all electronic surveillance. Vic bet he could use it to steal the Key, one of the most heavily guarded items in the universe, so he did.

While he was in the Key's building, he heard the Siriusian leadership discussing what they were going to do with the Key, which was supremely dastardly, and which he is about to explain, but then they are interrupted.

Prince Drufus shows up with his own robots, which have tracked the key nearby. Vic volunteers to help fix the robot's sensors, which seem to be malfunctioning, with the intent of really hiding the key from them.

Butch makes fun of Max's flute playing, so Max opens up the door to his special organ, which he begins playing wildly and at great volume. Jenny notices a nearby painting of a girl and asks Max about it. He says she was a friend, Sarah. The painter, Arthur Dekker, was also a friend. He got cancer and slowly had his body parts replaced by cybernetics. As he did, his paintings became more formal and less emotional, but he was able to sell them for enormous amounts of money. He became more and more obsessed with machines and they lost touch.

They all go outside and the robots from Antarctica attack. They fight back, and Max is able to stop them with a magnet grenade. Then more robots show up, led by Arthur Dekker, now going by Dekko (whose head looks like the Chrysler Building, a famous art deco building). He wants the Key.

Under threat, Vic gives it up. Dekko explains that the Door at the Edge of the Universe, which the Key opens, will somehow end humanity and lead to the supremacy of machines. Drufus tries to stop him but Dekko hits him with a temporary blindness ray. Then Dekko notices the painting of Sarah and freaks out. He flies off.

Drufus is mad at Vic for stealing the Key but Vic says he'll help find it. They know Dekko has land in Antarctica so they all fly down there, where they find an enormous tower.</Summary>
