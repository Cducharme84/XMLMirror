  <Title>The Eyes of Dekko Pt. 1; The Adventures of Zot! in Dimension 10 &#189;! #17</Title>
  <Series>Zot!</Series>
  <Number>17</Number>
  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>Dekko, who is getting psychiatric treatment, sees everything as a swirling mass of high-contrast abstract compositions. His vision of the world is very different than what a normal human sees. Similarly, his internal monologue is very different than how he speaks to others. Inside, he rants madly about escape, metal, and flesh; to his therapist, Dr. Glass, who he has persuaded that he is healthy, he speaks like a gentleman.

Glass holds a dinner in Dekko's honor and Dekko thanks them all for their trust in him.

In Zot's dimension, Max is throwing out many of the paintings he has made recently. Jenny is in tears at the destruction of what she sees as priceless works of Max's self-expression. Zot says Max does this all the time and is inured to it. Max gleefully burns it all with a flamethrower.

Zot brings Jenny home. It is the end of the school year and she has to take her finals. Next year she starts 10th grade, which in her district is the first year of high school.

She does well on her tests because Zot has been helping her study. She and Terry reminisce about Woody hitting on her at the start of the school year. Terry says Woody left to study abroad soon after. Jenny still feels bad about treating him poorly.

Jenny slips on some water and a tall, handsome boy helps her up. She is shocked to realize it is Woody. She immediately has a crush on him.

Back in Zot's dimension, Jenny and Max are painting and drawing en plain air. Zot is flying around enjoying himself. Jenny and Max talk about art. She doesn't feel like she's any good at it and wonders if Zot is interested. Max says Zot is totally unartistic but gives Jenny a lesson about art. He has her throw an empty frame on the ground, then asks her to look at what it's framing. There are no artistic subjects, he explains; everything is interesting once you look at it.

Dr. Glass releases Dekko in the middle of nature, which Dekko says he does appreciate after all. However, he still sees it through his abstracted vision.

Jenny and Woody hang out and bond. Woody explains that even though he has matured on the outside to look like what society thinks of as handsome, he still thinks it's what's inside that counts. He still has a crush on Jenny too. They talk about how they feel like no one understands them and they can't talk about how they feel. Woody provides a different outlet for Jenny than the relatively non-introspective and very visceral Zot.

That night, there's a birthday party for Zot at Max's house. All their friends, and Max's band, are there. Then Dekko shows up.

Note: 9-Jack-9 only appears in his human identity as John Sheers.

In The Adventures of Zot in Dimension 10 &#189;!, Zot and Jenny go to a science museum where a demonstration with a robot goes amok.</Summary>
