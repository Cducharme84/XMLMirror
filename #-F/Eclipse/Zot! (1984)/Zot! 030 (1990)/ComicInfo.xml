  <Summary>Jenny's mom, Barbara, narrates this issue. She thinks about the various economic and life problems she and her husband, Horace, are having, and that it may be time for a divorce. She always liked this season but now it can feel sad.

Jenny and Zot arrive. Jenny hears her mother coming and freaks out since it's hard to explain Zot's appearance. However, Barbara has no problem and is glad to meet him. She thinks he and Woody are both nice options for Jenny.

They all help rake leaves. Barbara remembers when she and Horton spoke with her parents about maybe getting married. Her dad grilled Horton about what kind of job he had. Horton had big dreams of being a newspaper editor. Barbara's dad was more focused on the practical but he accepted what Horton wanted to do.

Butch comes out. Barbara is mad at him for drinking and driving last night, and for eating the last of Jenny's birthday cake. They get in a shouting match; he thinks they're getting divorced and are going to ditch the kids.

Jenny is sure the marriage can be saved, but she may be too idealistic about it.

Woody arrives and talks with Zot. Zot also has idealistic feelings about the marriage, but Woody is more hardened to reality.

Barbara remembers how, when she was a kid, they would burn their raked leaves. Her dad would first light one leaf, then the pile. She loved the smell. She liked to image how, if the universe is infinite, there might be another version of her out there somewhere, waiting to hear from her.

Barbara tells Zot, Woody, and Jenny that as you get older, your dreams become more pragmatic. Woody understands but Zot still has big dreams.

Woody mentions to her how smell is a great way to stimulate the memory and that maybe she should light a leaf on fire to recall her childhood.

Barbara takes the kids to a movie. She remembers when Horace took a job he didn't want at IBM in order to better provide for the kids, in effect selling out. She didn't want him to take the job. That ultimately led to their current unhappiness.

Barbara goes home, lights a leaf on fire, and smells it, remembering happily.

In the "Adventures of Cynicalman," he tells about when he lost his job and dealt with a variety of travails that followed.</Summary>
