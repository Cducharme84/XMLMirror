  <Title>Getting to 99 Pt. 1; The Adventures of Zot! in Dimension 10 &#189; 19</Title>
  <Series>Zot!</Series>
  <Number>19</Number>
  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>Issues 19 and 20 were released at the same time. They are part one and two of the same story. They stand out from the rest of the series because McCloud wrote and did the breakdowns for them, but Chuck Austen did the art because McCloud was on his honeymoon.

Zot has been asked to save a group of people in a 99-story underground city. At the bottom is a clock. If it gets to noon, it will connect to some bombs and destroy the base. The local military hires Zot and equips him with weapons to get through. Each type of weapon has a certain number of charges so he has to be careful in using them. The whole story is like a video game, where Zot has to beat 99 levels with limited gear.

Jenny communicates with Zot about how to navigate the maze of the levels, using her lightning bolt necklace. Josh Hacker also helps by communicating with some inhabitants who live in the city. They wonder if a saboteur is behind all this or if it was a malfunction.

Zot flies through each level, getting down bit by bit. He only has 40 minutes to get to the bottom. He runs into janitor robots, civilians, offices, cityscapes, robot police, and a power station.

Zot flies so fast that when he enters a new area, he doesn't notice a tree right in front of him and runs into it, knocking himself out on level 50.

 

 

In "The Adventures of Zot! in Dimension 10 &#189;," a Worker Unit robot loves to work. Everyone is ordered to stop working. Then Zot and friends do some work to attract the Worker Unit. Woody almost catches it but it breaks out and attacks Zot.</Summary>
