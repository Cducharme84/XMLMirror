  <Title>Jenny's Day; The Adventures of Zot! in Dimension 10 &#189;: The Art of Work</Title>
  <Series>Zot!</Series>
  <Number>28</Number>
  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>This is the first of what McCloud calls the "Earth Stories"--stories that take place entirely on Jenny's Earth instead of Zot's fantastical dimension.

Jenny dreams of the wonderful time she would have if she lived in Zot's universe, but wakes up in reality in her own universe, which she hates. It seems like everything goes wrong for her today, and she acts in a bitter or frustrated way in return. Butch gets into the shower first, so she turns on the sink to give him a burst of cold water. Her mom talks about how her dad has left for Seattle for six weeks so she and he have space to figure out their marriage.

She gets ready to go and tells Zot, who is floating in her room, that she'll meet him outside. They go to her school for the day; he uses technology to turn invisible so only she can see him.

She meets up with Terry, then Woody. Zot eavesdrops on all their coversations by floating above.

Jenny hates all her classes and suffers through her day. At lunch, she hangs out with Terry and her new friends, who are Woody's fellow role-players and their siblings: George, Ronnie, Brandy, Spike, and Elizabeth. Zot makes himself visible and eats with them; they've all met him by now.

They all complain about school. They ask where he lives, and he says in Jenny's bedroom, which makes Woody do a spit-take until he explains that he lives in a metal box that's bigger on the inside than the outside.

Jenny looks forward to the only class she enjoys--art--but it has been canceled. She has Zot turn her invisible and skips gym so they can fly around outside, including to the big city. Eventually they go home again.

They kiss and say goodnight. Zot invites her to check out his living quarters in the box, she says, no, and they separate. Jenny hears her mom on the phone with her dad, having a fight, and the mom, in a fit of frustration, calls Jenny and Butch "little monsters." Jenny goes to sleep, feeling hurt, and still hating her Earth. Only her dreams are an escape.

In the "Art of Work," Zot and Max visit Dekko, who is working as an artist in his Antarctic base. They find out he is behind on rent so they try to get him a variety of jobs. However, he fails at all of them, mostly because he tries to turn all of them into a shrine of nothingness. Finally they find a letter for him at his base, with a check for three million dollars for one of his old paintings. This will cover the rest, so from now on he will just keep painting.</Summary>
