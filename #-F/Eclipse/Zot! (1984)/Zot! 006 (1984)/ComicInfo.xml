  <Summary>Drufus and Vic wake up after their air-car crashes in the desert. Vic helps Drufus with some clothes but Drufus is in a self-pitying mood and constantly complains when he's not yelling at Vic. Vic says they need to wait til the fire burns off before looking for the Key in the crash site.

A bureaucrat warns Zot and his group back at the palace that there's a conspiracy to overthrow the king, but they already knew that. But he also knows the queen is the next target.

One of the conspirators, Swimbler, escorts the queen into the same room where the king was killed. 9-Jack-9 is waiting there to kill her as well. Zot breaks in to save her, but Jack stuns her. They fight. After hearing Zot's last name, Jack says he killed a man and a woman with that name 3 years ago, which is when Zot's parents disappeared.

Drufus and Vic continue through the desert. They have very little water and the sun is very hot. They keep arguing.

The conspirators meet and threaten Swimbler, since they can tell Jack hasn't killed the queen yet. If Swimbler is no longer a royal advisor, he's no longer in a position to help them.

Drufus realizes that the walking stick he's been carrying is a fold-up umbrella. They enjoy a respite from the sun in its shade.

The conspirators try to arrest Jenny, Max, and the others. Butch escapes. When they blast Peabody, Jenny grabs his pistol.

Vic and Drufus warm up to each other. Vic helps Drufus role play how to stand up to his uncle and father. The finally see a rescue ship.

Zot and 9-Jack-9 continue to fight. Zot is losing his cool after hearing what might have happened to his parents. Jack starts to strange him. Jenny breaks in with the pistol. The pistol can't hurt Jack but she short-circuits him with a jug of water. The queen wakes up and they prepare to avenge her husband. However, more guards come up and try to arrest even the queen.

The air-ship lands in the desert to rescue the prince. However, when they find out Vic is the thief of the Key, they prepare to shoot him, even though Drufus says to stop. Drufus jumps in front of the beam. The guards fly off, fearing they killed their own prince.

Vic eventually wakes him up and they start to walk again. Vic admits he has had the Key this whole time, but now he trusts Drufus. However, later that night he realizes that Drufus has succumbed to his wounds.

The end of the issue features several drawings by Dekko as well as a letter from his psychiatrist to Max, saying that he is doing a little better.
