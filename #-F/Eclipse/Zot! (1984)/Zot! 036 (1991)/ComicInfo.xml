  <Title>The Great Escape; The Adventures of Zot! in Dimension 10 &#189;: Zot in the Act</Title>
  <Series>Zot!</Series>
  <Number>36</Number>
  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>The final issue of Zot! provides short moments on many of the characters that have become important in the "Earth Stories." Most of them are connected to the theme of a dream of being able to escape.

George lies in bed, thinking about how he has managed, with great effort, to achieve straight Ds in all his classes. He could easily get As, but thinks getting straight Ds is harder. It is one way he can control his world, since he feels he cannot control the way people might feel about him being gay.

Elizabeth reads escapist science fiction, and Spike tries to sleep, as their parents argue.

Zot wants to go fight crime in the city. He feels like he finally knows where it is and how he can stop it. Jenny is worried for him and pleads with him not to go. He promises to be back by 6am.

Ronnie imagines superhero characters with the ability to get away from it all.

Brandy believes that if she thinks positively, it will manifest itself in the real world. She holds her puppy, who her alcoholic mother hit.

Terry wants to go to Zot's world where her lesbian identity will be seen as normal.

Woody wakes up, but remembers he doesn't have to go to school until later, for his final exam.

It is past 6am. Zot hasn't come home. Jenny is worried. Butch comes in, drunk. Jenny tries to get him to help and eventually he agrees that she can get him if Zot isn't back in an hour.

All the other friends take their finals, with varying degrees of success. They notice Jenny never showed up and wonder where she is. Woody. tries calling her but doesn't get an answer.

Butch and Jenny walk through the city, looking for Zot by using the glowing pendant he gave her. It leads to a hospital. Zot has been badly hurt.

The other friends play their role-playing game. Jenny calls. She says Zot was shot by police when he was trying to help some people on crack. He has had multiple surgeries.

Woody's dad drives them all into the city. Jenny tells Woody she hates this Earth. Zot eventually wakes up. He seems ok. The friends all go home for the night.

Butch tells Jenny that their mother called. She is doing badly because she and Horace have finally agreed to a divorce. Jenny has been refusing to talk with her.

Jenny wakes up to Zot's voice, at first thinking it's a dream. He is all healed. Max finally found his way to their dimension and healed Zot; since time works differently there, it seems like just a few hours, but it has been weeks for him. Max and Zot invite Jenny and all their friends to come visit Zot's Earth.

They all show up to Jenny's backyard. All are excited. Ronnie, ironically, has the hardest time believing it. Jenny comes down with her suitcases and stuffed bear. She is ready to leave her Earth forever. Zot says she can't run from her problems. She doesn't care. He says if she stays in his world, he'll stay in her world. She finally agrees to only visit. Just as they're about to close the portal, Jenny's mom gets home, and they invite her in too.

The issue ends with them deciding that they deserve an escape from reality, even if they know they have to go back home eventually.

In "Zot in the Act," the friends (and almost the entire cast of the series) go to a movie about Zot, starring River Phoenix. Woody is depressed about how much Zot merchandise there is. Fans are everywhere. His villains are there to watch the movie too. The villain Art Dekko's brother, Zy Dekko, causes problems by turning River Phoenix into Dark River Phoenix. After some chaos, a producer offers to make Zy a movie sequel. He introduces more of Dekko's brothers, all with pun names. Zot and friends go outside, leaving all the craziness behind.</Summary>
