	<Summary>Alec and Abby bring the fight to Sethe's chosen servant in the blood-slicked slaughterhouses of west Texas! But while the battle is joined in America, the war may already be lost in the jungles of Brazil, as danger approaches for the Parliament of Treesâ€¦

 

Deep in the jungles of Brazil a man and his guide walk into a sacred part of the jungle. They are met by local tribesmen of the Terena who ask them to prove that they are reverent men lest they be killed. The man complies by taking off his shirt; this act is a trap. When he opens his shirt we see flies and rot and realize this man is a messenger of Sethe to attack the Parliament of Trees directly in their sacred grove.

Back in Texas Abby and Alec are in a small store looking for supplies. When they exit they are met by William who has brought an entire hoard of undead things from the towns slaughterhouse. They are attacked but retaliate with force and trap William in a tree. Alec and Abby bandage themselves up when William goes hysterical. Through his cheering he tells them that the Rot has won. We are sent back to Brazil where the messenger has found the sacred grove and is now attacking the Parliament physically. Alec grows weak.
