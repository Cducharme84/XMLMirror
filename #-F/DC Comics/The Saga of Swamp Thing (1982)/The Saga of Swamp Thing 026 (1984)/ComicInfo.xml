  <Summary>Paul Blood explains to Abby about the danger she has to protect Paul and the other children in Elysium Lawns from. Abby returns to Elysium Lawns and is explained that all the children are acting weirder that normal, they are being violent and they all have made similar draws of a white, creepy creature; when he meets Paul for the second time since she met him, he explains her about the Monkey King, he says to her that he's gonna scare her to death, Abby believes him but is afraid that nobody else is going to believe them.

Abby then gets back to The Swamp Thing asking for help and trying to explain everything to him, but he already knew, as he can feel it in the air; together they get back to Elysium Lawns in an effort to save the kids from such great danger, when they get there, The Monkey King has already begin to attack the children, but The Demon joins the battle against him.

Meanwhile, Matthew is getting drunk in his home after fighting with Abby and decides to go find her. Drunk as he was, is not easy to drive in the night and he crashes his car against a tree.

[Notably, this is the first issue Etrigan speaks in rhyme, which has followed the character from writer-to-writer to present day.]
