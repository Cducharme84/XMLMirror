The Raccoon Kids trick Uncle Percy into buying them sodas by convincing him that he's dying of thirst in a desert.

A duck child sees a spoiled rhinoceros nag his father into buying him a giant ice cream cone. He tries the same thing on his Uncle Doodles, who returns a bicycle that he had bought him for a birthday present. The duck kid punches the rhinoceros kid and is rewarded with a bicycle by the rhinoceros father.

Two bear cubs are trying to get honey from a beehive and get stung. Blackie takes the beehive from them. They send a bee after Blackie, then discover that the hive is still full of bees when they take it back.

Uncle Percy tells the Raccoon Kids to stop playing cops and robbers. They play baseball and hit him with a ball, so he spanks them. They squirt him with water to put out his pipe.
