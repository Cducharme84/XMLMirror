  <Summary>Huon, the Leveller, uses Tim's key of worlds to help them escape the seas they were on, and transports them to a mountain in Faerie.  Huon explains that it is his job to destroy realms when their seeming becomes too far out of sync with their reality, as is the case with Faerie.

Huon transforms himself into an angelic form.

As the Faeries back at the castle fear Huon's coming, Titania's maid Selwyn leaves by a secret door, and transforms back into her true form of Auberon. He finds the stone head of Amadan, and asks him what's going on.  He explains how Yarrow tricked him, and asks for his help, but Auberon leaves him.

Yarrow helps the blind Molly fight off Taik.

Huon explains the Teind to Tim.  The Faerie started off as creations of nature and the earliest human imaginations. They had no home, and were harried by humanity. One day, a being came to their eight rulers, and said he would help.  He took them to a new land, Faerie, but Huon (one of the leaders) thought he sensed something terrible underneath its seeming.

The being revealed himself to be Lucifer, and said that they could have the land if they would send seven of themselves to his land every seven years.  The eight lords agreed, with Huon being less sure.  Lucifer then took the other seven lords away to Hell.

Huon became the first kind of Faerie, but his guilt literally consumed him and Faerie forgot about him.  Only the rulers of Faerie knew what they had to give up for the Teind.

Yarrow goes behind Taik, and pretends to yell to Titania that she has found her son and the "dangerous" Molly, which is the cue to Molly to turn and grab Taik. Unfortunately, Taik dodges and grabs Yarrow.

Auberon shows up, and grabs Taik.

The demons in the Hell-ship demand that Titania let them leave, but she is not the one holding them there.  A fog has come up, and surrounds all, leaving them--Titania, Auberon, Yarrow, Taik, Molly, and everyone else--alone with their fears and confusion.

All of Faerie has been turned into the fog, eliminating it all.  Huon explains that they didn't know who they were, or where they were--now they know: Hell.
