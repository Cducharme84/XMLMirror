  <Summary>Part 3 of the 3-part 'Sacrifices.' Tim Hunter must confront his evil future self, then decide whether he's willing to commit murder in order to save his father's life. In the process, Tim displays his first major act of mystical prowess. 

Sir Timothy browbeats Martyn, who has shrunk to miniature size, and destroys his magical items. Since Sir Timothy no longer has his memories of his childhood, he doesn't whether Martyn can help or hurt the young Tim into growing up to be Sir Timothy. He asks Barbatos, who is more interested in eating junk food, and who is clearly actually the one calling the shots. Barbatos tells Sir Timothy that Martyn isn't the man to help. 

We next see Tim in Marlyn's house, where Leah ended up leading him. They kissed earlier, Tim's first. He is (not literally) entranced by her. He goes to see Martyn, but the golem outside grabs him to keep him out. Tim uses his magic to redraw the golem's clay face, and renames him Happy; he is now under Tim's control. 

Leah sees it happen, and is amazed; she says such a thing is impossible. She checks in on Martyn for Tim, and sees that he's dead. She's very happy--and free. 

She tells Tim they're going to the hospital. While he changes, she frees the rest of her birds. However, while she is free of Martyn, she is still magically chained to her box.

She gets his car, and pulls up outside Tim’s house. She asks him to get her box. She decides she likes Tim for real, and wants him to be her new master. She tells him she’s a succubus, and that Martyn is dead. She burns Martyn’s house and they drive off to the hospital. She tells Tim he can heal his dad if he sacrifices a cat, but Tim can’t do it. He tries to use his own magic to heal him, but can’t bring himself to do it: the love isn’t there. As he says, “cats enjoy life. Dad didn’t.”

As her new master, Tim tells Leah that she is her own master now, and she is truly free. Tim takes the cat home.

Sir Timothy and Barbatos are back in the future. The demon has an even tighter grip on Sir Timothy, and can even make him enjoy living in a box on the street.
