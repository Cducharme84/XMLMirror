  <Summary>Part 2 of the 3-part 'Sacrifices.' Tim learns that a great sacrifice is necessary to guarantee his father's survival. But Tim's neighbor Martyn has a far greater plan in mind for the boy. 

Tim pulls his unconscious father out of his burning chair using magic, but Bill is very badly burned.

To Tim's shock, the fire brigade gets there and whisks away his "uncle," as they call him. Tim has had it with the incessant difficulties of his life, and determines to make changes.

However, when he goes inside, Martyn tells him that Constantine sent him to protect Tim, and apologizes for his failure. Tim tells him to get stuffed.

Martyn sends Leah out to console Tim, as part of Martyn's plan for her to seduce him. Before she goes out,he tells her to eat one of her birds, but instead she lets it go--she's starving herself instead of causing harm.

Tim starts to clean the house of all the detritus and the objects that kept his dad in a slump. Molly sees the burnt chair outside, and comes in. She and Tim bond. Molly says her own family is "fey" and seems to have a magical bent. Tim says he wants to kill the people who did this, but Molly, while sympathetic, gives him an earful about the cycle of violence back home in Ireland. Leah, instead of talking to Tim, just listens; she respects Molly and wants Tim to listen to her.

Unfortunately, Tim is angry and takes it out on her, telling her off. Molly leaves. Leah is now angry at Tim, and walks in, once again determined to suborn him.

Martyn watches Bill in the hospital via a scrying, but then he is blindsided by a ball of magic arising from Tim's shame, which he feels after Molly's talking-to. While Martyn is stunned, he is suddenly confronted by the adult Sir Timothy, who says the young Tim is his.
