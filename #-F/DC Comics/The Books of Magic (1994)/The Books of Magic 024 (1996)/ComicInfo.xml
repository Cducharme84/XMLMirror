  <Summary>Molly is staying with her grandmother in Ireland, after returning from Hell. They have a special relationship, as her gran shares her occasional magical sense of the world. Gran gives her a letter about Tim, which felt dangerous to her, and she asks Molly to read it on top of a reputedly magical hill.

Molly agrees and rides off. When they get there, the horse starts to eat the letter. Although it's torn, she manages to read most of it. It's from Gwendolyn, and relates the after-effects of the previous issue: Tim returned home and got into a row wth his dad about Cyril. Gwen tried to convince him to stay home, but he left in secret in the morning, leaving a note asking her to relate his love to Molly. Gwen also plans to leave. Molly realizes that Tim heard what she said about him and his future self when she was with Marya.

Molly resolves to find Tim and patch up their problems. Knowing the magic of the hill, she hopes to get the aid of the local fairies in finding Tim. However, the Amadan was already watching her, and flies down. She recognizes him from when she met Auberon, and he introduces himself as a fool. She laughs, at which he is angered, but she says she is the greater fool. He challenges her to a contest of who is the greater fool, and will grant her her desire if she wins. The other giant rocks on the hill are proof of what happens to losers. The Amadan flies off to prepare, and one of the stones gives her advice as she waits: follow her heart while in faerie.

(Gwendolyn ["Sister Staylace"] only appears through her writing in the note.)
