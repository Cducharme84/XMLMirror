  <Summary>Part 3 of the 5-part 'Playgrounds.' Tim, Tanger and Happy the Golem must navigate Hell's playground to rescue Molly...and discover in the process that demons never play fair. 

Tim, Tanger, and Happy, having arrived in Hell, which strangely looks like a mix between a mall and an airport, now must figure out how to find Molly and Crimple.  Tanger is surprisingly not dying, now that he's away from his home tree, but is instead sprouting new growths while sitting on Happy.

Sir Timothy, now that he has been awakened to his previous bondage to Barbatos, walks the streets of the future and even gives a cart of cash to a homeless man due to his love of the man's musical work.  Timothy goes to the Chinese restaurant that recently offered him a job.  He tells the owner, who knows who Timothy really is, that he'd like to buy a box to bury Barbatos in.  However, the owner notes that Timothy is too saddled with self-centeredness and that he would perhaps be happier as a dragon.  At that, the owner himself turns into a dragon.

While young Tim is recognized as a living boy in Hell, he manages to avoid capture.

Araquel the fallen angel does Barbatos's bidding, and tries to make sure that Tim's friends and allies don't come rescue him in hell.  However, he realizes that they were all busy anyway, and that Barbatos really wanted him to be too busy to find Nikki and Khara.

Vuall the demon governess forces Molly to read morality stories intended to make her agreeable and submissive, by torturing Crimple if she does not comply. In particular, she reads the story of Shrinking Violetta, who meets "No One," who punishes her for being independent.

Tim, now in the woods of hell, meets someone named No One.
