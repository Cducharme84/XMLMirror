  <Summary>Huon, a strange being known by many aliases, celebrates the end of one of them by dancing on the point of a needle, then enters its head and transforms into a fairy.

Tim, who has not appeared for a couple issues, and was last seen wandering the desert and meeting with Crazy Lightning, has randomly appeared in another realm, without knowing how or why. He is stuck on an island, and whenever he tries to get off, he just ends up back there again--but unknown to him, statues of himself, from every escape attempt, litter the far shore.

Members of Faerie surround the tree where the Amadan is holed up. They are angry at the destruction caused by Molly's burning, and are adrift in their identities, often without their glamours that make them seem more wonderful than they really are.

Yarrow flies out above the mob, showing them the head of Amadan--she tricked him into turning himself into stone.

She sees the ship from Hell, filled with demons, but doesn't understand why they are here because it is not the time of the Teind.

Titania confronts them. They want recompense for Taik, her son, who was supposed to be their prisoner, but is now returned to human form with Molly. The demons want her to refuse, so they can destroy Faerie, which they say once belonged to Hell.

However, Titania says she is not afraid of them. She is preparing for battle--but against the Leveller. Hearing this, the demons race back to their ship, but it won't fly away.

Molly has been overcome by her faerie fire, and can't see Taik, who circles her, taunting her. He has been taken over by, or is transforming into, a spirit that manifests itself as a skeletal horse. He still wants her to marry him, for her power. He wants revenge on Titania, but is also happy to kill her.

Yarrow appears, and invisibly tells Molly she will help.

Huon appears in Tim's boat in his Faerie form. He takes Tim's key (the key of worlds, gained in the original Books of Magic miniseries #3, and rarely if ever seen since), and tells him that Openers like Tim, and Levellers like himself, do what they must, and that right now, they are imprisoned, and must find a way out.
