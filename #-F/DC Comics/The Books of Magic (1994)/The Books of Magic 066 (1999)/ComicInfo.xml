  <Summary>It's the most important day in Tim Hunter's life in Part 1 of the 2-part "A Day, A Night, and a Dream." In this jumping-on point story, young mage Tim Hunter, disguised as a kitchen girl at the Inn Between Worlds, experiences identity crises, ghosts, faeries, and a visit from a long-lost loved one. But at the Inn Between, things are rarely what they seem. 

Tim, wearing a glamour stone to appear as his mother, as going under her name, Mary, thinks of all the realms he's visited, and how they are all in tumult, because a magical storm has torn through all the realms and opened their gates, so everyone can travel anywhere. All the lords of the realms are losing control over their now-free people.

Tim/Mary is in the Inn Between Worlds, one of four Free Houses that are independent and safe for everyone. He works there with Joh for Accasbel, among all the crazy beings that have come for refuge. Accasbel is frustrated with freeloaders who try to hide in the tavern so they don't have to pay, and throws out a demon for that reason. They can all stay in the tavern during the day, but not at night.

It is "Mary's" day off, so she goes for a wash. On the way she finds a group of dead souls, who very often these days can't find the land of the dead. She points them on.

She goes to a pool, and as she's alone, takes off the stone so she can be Tim again. He is afraid he is losing his identity, being on the run, in a different realm, in an assumed form. As he swims, Tamlin (who died way, way back in issue 4) suddenly appears. He is excited to be with his son. Tim questions him about how he's alive, but Tamlin says he has been looking all over for him. They go to the Inn together, with Tim now in his true form, which no one recognizes.

They see Joh, who seems to recognize Tim, and gives them a free pint. They also talk to the demon Puzzlestick, who keeps trying to get enough money to stay the night, but refuse his gesture of telling a story.

Puzzlestick goes on to talk to some women. After they refuse him, he tells them that they are all dreams of old lovers. Tamlin finds a coin and gives it to Puzzlestick so he stops bothering the women. Tim realizes that Tamlin is a dream, like the women, and leaves.

Tim runs into some faeries who are trying to hide. Titania is coming, and did not give them permission to leave Faerie. Titania comes in the Inn, looking for her subjects. She has no power here as a queen, however, since it is a Free House. Tim puts on the stone again so she won't recognize him. Tim, as Mary, runs into Joh. She is excited to share the fact that she just saw Tim, who she is in love with, and has a photo of!
