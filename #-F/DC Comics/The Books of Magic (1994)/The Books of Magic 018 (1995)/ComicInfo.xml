  <Summary>Part 4 of the 5-part 'Playgrounds.' Trapped in Governess Vuall's department of Hell, Molly and Tim share their first kiss, while Barbatos reveals his grand plans for taking over the world. 

The "No One" that Tim just met reveals himself to be...yet another Tim.  He tries to convince Tim that he's no one too, and Tim's usual neuroticness, in the form of many little "Me"s, works against him for a second, but then Tim "mans up" and intimidates the demon into telling him where to find Molly.  The "Me"s follow Tim, but he starts to get more confident in his use of magic, and begins to winnow them away, becoming more confident in himself in the process.

Vuall tries to get Molly to admit to the rightness of the morality stories she's been reading, but Molly and Crimple fight back.

Sir Timothy wakes up.  After being asked if he wanted to be a dragon, he had fainted, and a turtle wearing glasses popped out of his head.  He now wakes to find two dragons, waiting. Timothy realizes that the turtle was wearing fear-tinted glasses, and was a symbol of his continual inability to commit.  He agrees to be a dragon, and the others transform him, whereupon the play some card games.

Barbatos is holding a giant conference of demons.  The snack-food-loving demon plans to expand demons' power into the world by creating "Happy Crisps," which, like drugs, will delude the populace into serving hell. However, Happy and Tanger show up and crash the joint.

Tim runs into a Troll who requires him to pay a toll to cross a bridge: he must read a story, like Molly.  His is, "The Boy Who Chose the Sea."  It tells of a people without a sun, who can only see via candles, which have an unknown origin.  One being, who wishes to be free of the dark, flies out, only to find a building that makes candles out of people who are not afraid of the dark.  He escapes to the sunlit world.  Here Tim stops, and assumes an unhappy ending about staying in your place, and not learning things like magic.

Tim, angry, uses his magic to get past the demon.  The bridge magically takes him to Molly and Crimple, who have made Vuall their captive.  Molly tells Tim off for leading her to hell just for being his girlfriend, but is really joking. They kiss.  Love starts spreading through the room in the form of color and flowers.
