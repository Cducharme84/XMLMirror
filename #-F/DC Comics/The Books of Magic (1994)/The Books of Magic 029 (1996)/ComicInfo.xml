  <Summary>The sprites Woodbine and Yarrow, who were excited to help build Molly's treehouse, are now confused by her attempts at gardening.  Creative work like this is not natural in Faerie.  Molly, however, is mostly interested in growing herself some food (from real-world seeds). Yarrow in particular is amazed at Molly's ability to sing and be cheerful as she works.

Tim and Leah visit Zatanna, to ask her to help mentor Tim, but she's not at home.

Two kids try to get in a protected area of the Mojave desert known as Little Moon, which is currently being used as a set for a film.  They've come there in the past, before the film company fenced it off, due to its local reputation as a magical place. However, the guards run them off.

Suddenly a whirlwind with a human figure inside knocks down the fence and rushes into the center of the space.

Tim and Leah decide to go camping in the desert, with the city-bred British Tim feeling uncomfortable in the wild--and with the fact that they only have one tent, which means sharing it with succubus Leah.  They hear a sound, and find an unconscious mermaid lying on the ground, tangled up in the remains of the fence.

Yarrow tries her hand at gardening, but isn't succeeding.  Titania comes by, and puts a Faerie seed in Molly's garden, and threatens Yarrow if she tells. Titania is angry with Molly for taking her subjects' attention away.  Titania magically advances time, and the garden grows.

Leah and Tim can't figure out why there's a mermaid in the desert, and can't move her--her body is like water.  Leah moves their camp near her, as Tim is entranced by the topless mermaid's assets, leading Leah to realize that Tim hasn't slept with Molly yet.

Despite their attempts, the mermaid is dying, although she does wake up.

Molly wakes up and talks with the horse she freed last issue, which she calls Prince. She is amazed at how the garden grew, and eats a Faerie berry, realizing as soon as she does that she's trapped in Faerie forever.
