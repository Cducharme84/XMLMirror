  <Summary>Death of the Endless comes for Tim Hunter...but she's only one of several forces deciding the young magician's fate, even as his true parentage is revealed. 

Tim's father sits besotted at home, wondering where Tim has gone, and depressed about their rift.

Tim is visiting Death in an apartment, having tea, although Tim has a hard time believing that's who she is.  He's near death, back in Faerie, and she brought him to her so he won't be in his body, in pain.

Tamlin sits near Tim's body, in horror at what happened to him.  He's Tim's father, and yet has barely known him.  He flies Tim to Titania, so she can cure him, after Tim helped destroy the Manticore and brought life and magic back to Faerie.  Bu she says there is no cure for Manticore's poison.

Death asks Tim why he's so obsessed with knowing who his father is.  She tells him that while Bill Hunter may not be his biological father, he's still the man who raised him and the man who fills the role of a father in his life.  She finds an envelope, and magically puts it in his pocket.

Tamlin and Titania argue about Tim's fate.  Tamlin is tired of living carefree in Faerie, since he once came from Earth. Later, Tamlin casts a spell to sacrifice his life for Tim's.  Tim wakes up and finds the envelope.  Titania, finding the dead Tamlin and the living Tim, tells Tim that she is his mother, and she curses him for taking away her love, Tamlin.

Tim is tired of all these people, and tells her off, and uses his magic stone to go home, with the envelope still in his pocket.
