  <Summary>Part 2 of the 2-part 'Small Glass Worlds.' Tim and Titania have an unlikely reunion as the question of Tim Hunter's true parentage is settled once and for all. 

Salamander is reduced to trying to sell magic items on the street after the destruction of Slaggingham's sewer base.  Titania and the Amadan, in London, pass by him with condescension.

Tim and Molly finally get to have some ice cream, and are observed by Circe, a tattoo artist.

Staylace--now going by her first name, Gwendolyn--runs into Tim and Molly, and introduces them to Auberon, who still hasn't put his soul back in his body.  A mental construct of Gwendolyn teaches Auberon's soul about being responsible within the globe.

Marya (protected by the unicorn) and Daniel argue; he feels she ran out on him, but she just wanted to grow up in the real world. The unicorn stabs Daniel after he slaps Marya. Daniels leaves.

Gwen wants Tim to help Auberon, but Tim gets worried once he realizes that he's Titania's husband. He tries, but can't figure out how to do it.  Then Titania shows up.  She is angry at having to deal with the humans, and at the mess Auberon has gotten himself into. She tries to get the globe from Tim, but it falls and breaks.  Titania is about to wreak terror on them all in revenge for his presumably-lost soul, but it turns out that it went back into his body after all.

Auberon feels that he has learned something from being among the mortals, and stops Titania.  He wants to start a new relationship with her, after only playing at love for centuries.  He also asks Tim and Titania if Tim is her son, and she admits that it is true, and that Tamlin is the father.

However, Auberon says that Tim has no fairy blood, and so cannot be Titania's son, although he does look like Tamlin.  Auberon and Titania leave, with Tim once more unsure of his parentage. (This is wrapped up much later in the Books of Faerie, where it turns out that Titania was actually originally human as well, and so it is true that she is his mother, and that Tim's parents are both human.)
