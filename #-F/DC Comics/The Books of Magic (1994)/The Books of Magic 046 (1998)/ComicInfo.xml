  <Summary>The wedding ceremony between Bill Hunter and Holly continues after the disruptions of last issue.  They are finally wed, when Vasuki introduces himself to Tim and Araquel.  Vasuki was the doctor who healed Bill's face from its burns back in issue 14.

Circe, who gave Tim his tattoos (now gone) and was also seen quite some time ago, continues to change people into animals in order to improve their personalities and approach to life, but when various things go wrong with some of her pidgeon-people, she starts wondering if she is using the right approach. Something seems strange to her today.

Araquel can immediately sense something is off about Vasuki. Vasuki says he knows why there is a war in heaven.

Circe runs into Slaggingham, who is rambling on about the apocalypse. They both see the dead angels and demons littered all over the place from the war (although normal people can't see them).

Vasuki is cordial at the wedding as the bride and groom leave, and explains the source of the war: the devils want to make it a heaven, and the angels want to make it a hell, although he doesn't really explain why. He turns into a giant snake, and says he expects Tim to work with him for the Queen of Wounds, who will have a list of people for him to kill. Then he leaves.

Circe and Slaggingham argue about their religions' ideas of the afterlife and the end of the world, but Circe eventually agrees to go along with Slaggingham and see if his apocalyptic visions are real.

Two angels, Uriel and Mesukiel, sit outside the reception for Bill and Holly's wedding.  The revelers inside are having a ball, even Araquel and Auntie Blodwyn--although Cyril is busy putting up protective wards made of turkey gravy under the table. While the angels despise Cyril's shallow and pathetic understanding of their religion, they have a plan to use him as a tool to further their plans.  Uriel, the one who has to carry it out, is conflicted over whether this is really the right thing to do.

Tim and his dad have a good talk and get past their differences.

That night, Vasuki calls to Bill, who is magically transformed and slithers out the window.
