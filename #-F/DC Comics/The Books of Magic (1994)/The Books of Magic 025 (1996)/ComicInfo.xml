  <Summary>Tim, having determined to stay away from his family and friends so they are no longer in danger, goes to Brighton Beach, where he used to vacation.  He carries the miniature statue of his friend Jimmy, who was turned into that state by Reverend Slaggingham in issue 9.

Tim remembers when he and Jimmy were at the beach as kids.  His dad tells them a story about how all the pier workers are really cannibal pirates in disguise, which they almost believe until his aunt tells him it's not.

Tim misses being a carefree kid, his life now having been changed by both his mother's death and the world of magic.

In the flashback, kid-Tim pulls an ankh out of a pincer-toy machine.  They meet a strange old fisher man, J. Alfred Skinner, who says he'll trade them an all-day pass to the rides on the pier for the ankh.  He wants to use it as a lure on his fishing rod, to catch a muddle-mullah, a strange creature of the deep.

The kids think he's one of the pirates, but they give him the ankh and take the passes.

In the present, Tim laments that his new tattoos won't let him use his own magic to fix Jimmy.  He considers asking John Constantine to do it, and maybe he'll be able to stay with him, too.  Unseen by Tim, Skinner is watching him.

In the past, Tim and Jimmy are on the Ferris Wheel when it gets stuck in place.  They're worried, but also enjoy just imagining about other lands while they're stuck.

Tim, wandering around feeling sorry for himself, sees Death (wearing the ankh) and Skinner. Skinner's seemingly dead body still stands by the side of the pier, fishing for the muddle-mullah, while his spirit talks with Death about his fishing attempts.  The muddle-mullah took part of his finger, and his soul, as a child.

Death volunteers Tim to help with Skinner's problem.  She also asks for Jimmy, who is dead, not just transformed.  Tim gives up Jimmy and goes to find the muddle-mullah, who turns out to be a normal crab.  He gives it to Skinner.

Death asks Tim if he wants to go get some pancakes.
