  <Summary>'Playgrounds' Epilogue. Drawn into a book of twisted fairy tales, Tim, Molly and Mr. Wrong must play the roles Barbatos has written for them if they're to reach the end of their ordeal alive. 

Tim, Molly, Sir Timothy (in the shape of a dragon), and Barbatos are in another of the strange storybooks that Molly and Tim were forced to read earlier.  Barbatos is attempting to control the storyline.

Tim finds himself lost in a forest, and temporarily turns into a knight.  He knows he is being manipulated by Barbatos, especially when a transparently fake owl, meant to look like his late familiar, Yo-yo, shows up.  Tim plays along but the owl steals his glasses.

Sir Timothy the Dragon and Molly are stuck in a weird metal cave with a hoard of treasure.  Sir Timothy is happy to be with Molly, but she (not knowing his identity) does not feel the same.  Finally he persuades her to dress up like a princess, and explains that he had been growing Mollys for years.  When she puts on the dress, her personality transforms into a haughty princess as well, and she starts being dismissive of the dragon.

Tim finds the cliff they're on, and at first seems to see Molly being threatened by the dragon.  However, Tim easily realizes that they are just more of Barbatos's puppets, and magically creates a giant metal knight to knock them aside and go after the demon.

He finally catches Barbatos, but realizes that Molly is now trapped under the collapsed mountain.  Only Sir Timothy holds up the ceiling protecting her.  Molly snaps out of it when the dragon finally tells her his true identity: a future Tim Hunter, who has lived a life he is not proud of.  He makes Molly promise to take steps to make sure young Tim doesn't turn out like him.

Outside, young Tim doesn't know how to get Molly out, but then his adult self blows a hole in the scrap with his dragon breath. Molly escapes, but Sir Timothy dies due to the effort, and Molly feels sad for him as he does.  Molly fulfills her promise to the dragon, and makes young Tim swear by his name to never deal with demons--which is how Sir Timothy started down his dark path.  She doesn't, however, tell him who the dragon was.

She and Tim leave the story, with Barbatos still stuck there.
