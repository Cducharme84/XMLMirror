  <Summary>Auberon is crowned king. Because he is still a child, Obrey becomes the regent, governing until he is older.

Obrey proposes marriage to Dymphna and she says yes. She is thrilled and he does love her too, but this marriage also consolidates power for him, since he is now not only regent but also the king's uncle by marriage. He plans to have children with Dymphna to create his own possible line of succession.

However, Bridey, Dymphna's aide, is not as excited as her lady; Bridey can see the conflicts of interest.

Amadan continues to manipulate Obrey to make him more callous and power-hungry.

Auberon meets with Huonnor, the imprisoned contender for the throne. He wants to pardon him and make him his advisor, but Huonnor tells him not to. He can see that others are manipulating events and that this would put Auberon in danger.

Huonnor is killed in his sleep that night, too late to hear the news of his newly-born daughter. He is killed on the orders of Amadan.

Auberon, hearing the news, says he wants the baby brought to the court and kept safe. He will marry her when she is old enough, thus combining their lines. However, he can also see that he is in danger, and runs off until he is older.

Obrey now has complete power as regent.
