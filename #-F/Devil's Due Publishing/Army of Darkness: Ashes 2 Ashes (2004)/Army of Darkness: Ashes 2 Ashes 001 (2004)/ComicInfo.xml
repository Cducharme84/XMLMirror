  <Summary>He's back, Baby! Featuring characters from the film, Army of Darkness, this first issue finds Ash forced to leave behind the S-Mart when a face from the past recruits him for another go-round with the Necronomicon and its Deadite minions! Ash gets a "do-over" to set right a new problem caused by his misspeaking of those notorious magic words, charged with the unusual task of returning to a certain cabin in the woods on the fateful night he first learned of the existence of The Book of the Dead!

After a brief recap of what happened in Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness (The Movies) Ash is reunited with the old man from the past. The old man informs Ash that again he has spoken the words incorrectly and was returned to his time too early. The two heros gear up and head to the cabin to save Linda and pre-necronomicon from the Deadites.

When they get near the cabin they discover the bridge is out and the necronomicon has already been read from. They are attack by the trees, a possessed hillbilly and a demon Jackrabbit. When thats over they are attacked by a dozen possessed woodland animals which Ash blows up with a Moonshine still.

The last scene is Ash approaching the cabin saying "we ain't out of the woods yet"</Summary>
