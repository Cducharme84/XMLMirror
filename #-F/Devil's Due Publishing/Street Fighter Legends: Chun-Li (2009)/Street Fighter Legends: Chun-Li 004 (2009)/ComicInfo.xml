  <Summary>BASIC PLOT:

In the conclusion to Chun-li’s prequel miniseries, the strongest woman in the world comes face to face with the King of Muay Thai! It’s Chun-li VS Sagat, with the souls of eight thousand Chinese warriors on the line!

DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

Two guards approach the Hong Kong Royal Museum, apparently there to relieve the two guards already on duty. The on-duty guards don't recognize the newcomers, and one of them apologetically goes to make a phone call and confirm things when the two new guards suddenly lash out, knocking out the other two men with stun guns. They reveal themselves to be Shadaloo agents when they contact Sagat, telling him the entrance is now secure.

Sagat says not to disturb him unless something suspicious occurs then, turns his attention to the Terracotta statues. Staring into the eye of one of the statues, Sagat seems to lose himself for a moment, until a thug asks him what's wrong. Sagat snaps out of it and says that its nothing, and for the men to load the statues onto the truck. "We have a job to do."

Meanwhile, back at the restaurant from last issue, Chun Li, Po lIn and Dorai scatter as a spray of bullets tear through the place. Po Lin makes her way to the front door and identifies at least four shooters in the second floor of the building across the street.

Po Lin asks Dorai and Chun Li to cover her while she makes a break for the back exit. Dorai says it's too dangerous - that he'll go, but she says that he is old and slow and that the discussion is over.

Across the way, Gen takes out all the snipers, and asks them what their interest is in Dorai and Chun Li.

Just as Dorai is wondering why the shooting has stopped,his phone rings.Its one of the shooters, who says that he was ordered by Sagat to take them out before they could tell anyone about the museum heist. He says that Sagat should be loading the Terracotta statues onto a boat right then, from where they will be transferred to a submarine once offshore. He tells Dorai that Sagat believes they are all dead, because that is what he reported. Dorai asks why, and the man replies "Because someone told me to," as Gen stands over him. Gen tells the man to wait there for the authorities if he wants to live, but the man comes at him the minute his back is turned, and with a "ZANAI" attack, Gen regretfully kills the man.

Escaping from the restaurant, Dorai, Chun Li and Po Lin discover that the boat with the statues is already gone, and Dorai plots to intercept it. Deciding that one stealth is better then strength, he chooses to send only one boat with himself, Chun Li and Po Lin.

The three of them get the jump on Sagat and his men as they are about to move the statues over to the Shadaloo submarine, but one of the Shadaloo toughs opens fire and a brief gunfight erupts until both sides realize the statues are too valuable to risk harming. Instead Sagat's men engage the three police officials in melee combat. Chun Li and Dorai take them all out, but Po Lin is thrown overboard when she lets her anger overwhelm her judgment. Dorai and Chun Li then engages Sagat, who is beating them both pretty soundly until Dorai lands a "KIKOSHO" fireball attack on the Muy Thai fighter.

Before the fight can continue, Po Lin returns to the scene and holds Sagat at gunpoint. She suggests simply killing him to Chun Li and Dorai, who make it clear that doing so would be wrong, but before Po Lin can do anything Sagat suddenly lashes out. He knocks the gun from Po Lin's hands and follows up with a brutal kick that snaps the girl's leg. Seeing Police Helicopters heading towards him, Sagat jumps onto the still waiting submarine to escape, ordering it to submerge as he does so.

As Dorai calls for medical assistance for Po Lin, the injured girl apologizes to Chun Li, and says that she was right, apparently referring to her reaction to Po Lin's desire to shoot Sagat in the back of the head.

On the sub, Sagat remarks that Bison will have to make due with the six statues they managed to load on board. When he touches one, however, he suddenly receives a vision from the future. He sees a fighter, his face hidden in shadows, unleashing a brutal uppercut to his midsection, defeating him and leaving a permanent scar. The visions convince Sagat that Bison should never possess the statues, and the power they possess, so he destroys them and reports his failure to Bison. He says that none of the statues were retrieved due to Dorai's interference. Frowning, Bison states his resolve to do something about Dorai soon.

Later, Chun Li visits Po Lin in the hospital, where Po Lin tells her that she will be resigning from the force because she can't let revenge be the primary thing guiding her through life. Chun Li says she understands, and later Dorai and Chun Li accompany Po Lin when she visits her parents graves and tells them that she now realizes that the best way she can honor them is by lving her own life as they had wanted her to.

As they walk away, Chun Li asks her father if he thinks she would make the same decisions that Po Lin had if Chun Li had lost him. He replies that he trusts her to always do the right thing, and we see that the two of them are being spied on by Shadaloo Agent Killer Bee, apparently moments before she abducts Dorai.
