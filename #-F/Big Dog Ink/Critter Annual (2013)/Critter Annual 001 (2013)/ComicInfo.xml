  <Summary>High Tide has taken everyone by surprise. Some more than others, as is the case with the members of Super Pawn who are trapped underwater in their new store location. Charity is also struggling with not only the flooded cities, but also with her own inner demon. And Critter is being stalked by a familiar foe as she attempts to put an end to Tidepool's watery plans. Three separate stories bring the drama of High Tide to new heights.</Summary>
