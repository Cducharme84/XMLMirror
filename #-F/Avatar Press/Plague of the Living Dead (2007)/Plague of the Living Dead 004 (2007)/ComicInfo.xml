  <Series>Plague of the Living Dead</Series>
  <Summary>Their home town is a war zone. Their loved ones are surely dead. They are pursued by military police, intent on their capture. And there’s zombies roaming the streets of Stone Mountain… Hundred of flesh-eating, ravenous zombies! With nothing left for which to live and no hope for survival, a trio of Vietnam veterans plunge headlong into battle with the army of the undead that have destroyed everything to which they had hoped to return.

The PLAGUE OF THE LIVING DEAD has spread and devoured all in its path, but the trio of soldiers find that there may be a glimmer of hope, as they find a pocket of survivors in the local high school gymnasium. But will this last outpost of humanity be their salvation or will it become a horrifying death-trap?

As well as the standard cover by super-star Jacen Burrows, this issue is available with a Wraparound, Terror, Rotting and Gore cover by series artist Dheeraj Verma and a painted cover by Matt Busch.
