  <Summary>Hatchet-Killer!: Concerned about the number of hatchet murders in the community, Mrs. North begins to believe that her part-time maid may indeed be the culprit, and circumstances around the house seem to verify her conclusion. Later, scared to death, she murders the maid when suddenly her husband enters the home and tells her that the real killer had been caught hours before.

Revenge!: Lila was desperate for money and married a Texas millionaire oilman to get it. But when she met Phil, one of the workers at the oil wells, the two conspired to kill Lila's husband in an auto accident. The accident only paralyzed Mr. Aikley, however, but Phil threatened to blackmail Lila, and if she didn't come forth with money, he would tell the district attorney all about the accident.

Phonies: Faced with funds running out from his last safecracking job, Frank Shantly poured over a newspaper and eyed a story about a wealthy gambler having to go to Washington D.C. to testify before the Senate Committee. Immediately, he thinks that this is a neat set-up for another big payoff, but is confronted by a man claiming to be Adellis the minute he steps into the house. Convinced no one can break into his safe, "Adellis" bets Shantly $1,000 and his freedom that the crook can't get into the safe. Shantly wins the bet, but doesn't realize he has unwittingly helped the Feds round up a real crook!

Horror under the Big-Top!: Wanda is having an affair with "The Flying Aldar", famed circus performer. But when her husband suspects, the two plan to kill him by changing the angle of the cannon her husband will be fired from so he misses the safety net. Unfortunately, the body of Carlo hits his wife outside the tent, killing her. Justice is later served when Aldar attempts to do his act without a safety net, not knowing the late Carlo had cut his trapeze rope the night before!
