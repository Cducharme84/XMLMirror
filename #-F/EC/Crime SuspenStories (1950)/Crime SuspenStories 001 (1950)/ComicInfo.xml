  <Summary>Murder May Boomerang: Nearly inseparable, a father and son did everything in life together until that one day when a prisoner from a nearby penitentiary discovers the pair's cabin, where he steals clothing and nearly beats the father to death. Distraught, the son drives the father around, trying to locate the escapee, when the dazed father points out the villain, and the son runs him down with their car. Soon, however, the son realizes the father's mistaken identification.

Death's Double-Cross: Ruth was bored and lonely. Her two-year marriage to John was missing something: love, and she found it in John's twin brother. The two conspired to do away with John and thought they had.....but a little mole on the cheek of Ronald made Ruth wonder.

A Snapshot of Death!: A woman enters a pool room and hires a man to kill a lady, whose picture she provides to him. Imagine his surprise when he notes that the photo is of the woman wanting the crime committed.

High Tide!: Four men on a mail boat leave the infamous Mephisto Prison and soon hear by radio of the escape of one of the prisoners. When the boat's engine, clogged with sand, brings the craft to a halt a ways off shore, all fingers begin to point to each other as the culprit.
