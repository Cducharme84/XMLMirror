After she kills him, she drives out on a country road to dispose of the body, fakes an accident, collects the money and then meets George. George changes his insurance policy to now include his new wife, but when a tragic accident, similar to the one that killed Sam, occurs, Thelma is nailed for murder.

But the scheme backfires in an unusual way!
