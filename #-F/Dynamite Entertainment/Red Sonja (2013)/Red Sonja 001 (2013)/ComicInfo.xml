	<Summary>THIS IS IT. Red Sonja gets a fresh new attitude by the dream team of writer GAIL SIMONE (Batgirl, Birds of Prey) and artist WALTER GEOVANI (Prophecy, Witchblade), on the book they were born to create. Sonja pays back a blood debt owed to the one man who has gained her respect, even if it means leading a doomed army to their certain deaths! This thrilling new series features covers by the top female artists in the industry, including Nicola Scott, Colleen Doran, Jenny Frison, Fiona Staples, Amanda Conner and more. You do NOT want to miss this re-introduction the She-devil with a Sword!
