  <Summary>This is it! The final showdown between Ash and his evil, Egyptian counterpart! Ash will need both his chainsaw and boomstick going full-tilt if he hopes to keep an ancient Egyptian Army of Darkness at bay.

Ash is searching the tomb for a way to destroy the Necronomicon and finds himself in room full of Deadite puzzles. He thinks he sloved it but in stead the book has tricked him once again. Ash chases after it but finds himself face to face with Evil Ash.

Ash fights an army of Deadites but Evil Ash gets the upper hand. When all seems lost a time portal opens and Ash of the past, Henry, Arthur, Shelia, the Wise Man and an army from 1300 AD come to rescue. The two good Ashes meld together and fight Evil Ash.

The Wise Man explains the only way to stop the Deadite is to encircle it with fire, which Ash does in his usual over the top way. Now that the Deadites are defeated the group head back to 1300 AD, but the Wise Man gives Ash one final task, before the portal closes to thorw the book in with them.

Ash gets destracted by Shelia and forgets to do that one thing. THe last scene Ash is riding away completly unaware that the Necronomicon is laying on the ground glowing.</Summary>
