  <Summary>Ash finds himself behind that looking glass in a world over run with Deadites. He barely escapes possessed fable-like creatures to come face to face with a harder tuffer version of Sheila. The two escape into the wood and hide out in a fruit cellar while the Deadites look for them.

In the Cellar Ash is introduced to Herbie and H.P., who try to explain that there are many copies of the necronomicon, and that Deadites have taken over this mirror world and the only way to go back is threw that mirror he had entered. Ash wants to take Sheila back with him but H.P. explains she can only return when her other version looks in to a mirror too.
