  <Summary>The Red Queen Episode 2: Sonja learns that the crest she found secreted on Ariok's standard bearer belongs to the first kings of Sogaria who were supposedly incredibly evil and thought to have been long dead. When she returns to her army, still cleaning up after the battle of Astahan, she finds that her men have captured Ariok and his little sister. Finding her enemy to be somewhat noble, Sonja agrees to meet with him in single combat and promises to keep his true lineage a secret should she win the fight.
