  <Summary>Darrin, Dualla’s brother who should be dead, is captured and placed in Galactica’s brig.  Dualla questions her brother who tells her that he doesn’t remember anything after his death, but that he simply woke up on the medivac ship with the Cylons attacking.  Many in the fleet believe the returners are a fulfillment of an ancient prophecy found in the Sacred Scrolls--“The dead shall return in an ark of fire,” and work to hide the returners even though almost everyone who comes in contact with the returners becomes ill.  Zak is shuttled aboard Galactica by a group sympathetic to the returners.  When the group becomes sick, Zak calls for help and finds himself looking down the barrel of a gun held by his brother, Apollo.

Apollo after taking Zak to the brig, begins to interrogate him.  During the interrogation, Zak figures out that Apollo has a relationship with his former fiancé, Starbuck, and attacks Apollo.  During their brief fight, a member of the Earth Protectorate terrorist group breaks in but is subdued before he can kill Apollo.  Apollo then learns that Galactica’s pilots are being targeted by the group.  He and Zak hunt down and kill two of the terrorists, but shortly after, Apollo succumbs to the virus sweeping the ship.

The story ends with an older generation Cylon Basestar appearing.</Summary>
