  <Series>Terry Moore's Strangers in Paradise</Series>
  <Summary>Katchoo has cried all day and David is lost not knowing what to do. He finds Katchoo in the garden with a bottle in the rain and he carries her back inside.  In Tennessee Francine is at her mothers and has slept past noon dreaming of an award ceremony withe Clinton's honoring her and Kat. She wakes she her unopened suitcase and goes back under the covers. Francie floats about as her mothers friends call round and coo over her. Katchoo is a wreck and as she vomits David calls her "Baby". In a weak voice she tells him to never call her that. Later Carolyn rings and Katchoo says she'll take her offer but only for new works and no 'Francine' images at all.  Casey gets a huge shock when she walks into the living room and finds one of the six foot 'Francine' exhibit paintings in her living room. She heads over to talk with David, she is upset by Freddie and needs someone to talk with about Freddie and the overweight image of Francie's behind in her livingroom. In her impulsive way she leaps on him crying. Then in a mood swing she rips off her shirt and tries to kiss him. Only to be tapped on the shoulder by a maniacally grinning Katchoo.</Summary>
