  <Summary>Despite protests by the public and scientific community, the Phi Collider is complete and the 2-week activation process has begun. With the clock ticking, Congress calls an emergency session to discuss the situation. But Julie and Ivy have their own plan for stopping the controversial collider, and step one is loud. Very, very loud.

Julie and Ivy sleep on the ground outside the barn and when Ivy wakes in the night she finds Julie's hand on her breast, she puts her own hand over it and goes back to sleep. Come morning and when Julie wakes she snatches her hand away embarrassed.

Julie has no recollection of events since the missile attack and Ivy tells her they were attacked and Annie' saved them both. Julie is unselfconscious about being naked bar the patches the suit covers and even then its not much comfort.

In the abandoned house Ivy finds Hong on a filthy bed and morphine beside him. She offers to make it quick if he tells her with the collider is. He say we can't find it. Implying he is working as an informant for China. She sets fire to the bed and places a bottle of spirits next to his head and leaves.

The house explodes as they drive away.</Summary>
