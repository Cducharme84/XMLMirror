  <Summary>Only 5 issues are left in this adrenaline-laced series! Julie and Annie combine forces to fight their way through state-of-the-art security systems and the world's most formidable army. With nothing more than a shared body covered in Alloy 618, the odds are against them, but the girls must win to prevent the Phi Collider from destroying the planet!

In Alaska the team are hunting for the collider. They find a truck stop where Ivy had a package sent to and Julie wits outside and a snow fox comes and rests at her feet. The owner mentions the collider thinking they work there. Its an open secret and helps point them in the right direction.

Ivy opens the parcel in secret and inside is one of those control pads that Hong tried to put on Julie's wrist. The letter with it says they used half the alloy and reversed the charge on one pad as she specified and the finger she sent was dated at 27,500 years old.

Julie seems to be getting more knowledgeable as she grows taller and her skin is perfect making locals think she is a model or actress. They even want her autograph instead of payment. She signs Annie Trotter.

The crew head off trying to work out how to locate and infiltrate the collider.

As they drive Ivy phones for help, on the other end two women are relaxing on a sun drenched beach.</Summary>
