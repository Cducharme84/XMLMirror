  <Summary>The hunter becomes the hunted as Julie and Ivy team-up to track down the serial killer, Cain, and take away his only weapon, the alloy. Stakes are high as the girls must have the alloy to fight an even bigger fight - against an entire army!

Dillon visits his dad and leaves his dog and the Annie's papers with him for safety.

Hong drives the girls to an abandoned barn and while Ivy goads him the unconscious Julie is worked on by him. He is hoping the alloy will repair his ruined body and face. He is installing a pad like Annie had that will allow the alloy to just slide off again. Before he can finish Ivy frees her legs and kicks him mercilessly. She tries to wake Julie but Hong puts a shard of glass through her leg and knocks her out cold.

He installs the wrist pad but on attachment a beam of energy lances out of the pad and severs his left hand. Julies eyes turn silver as Annie takes over and carrys out Ivy and heals her ankle.

Vijay finds all of project Phi gone as well as Dr Foster.</Summary>
