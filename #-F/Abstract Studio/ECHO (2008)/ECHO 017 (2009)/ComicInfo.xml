  <Summary>Julie is getting used to the idea of another woman living inside her, but she is not so crazy about Annie using her body to reunite with boyfriend Dillon! Meanwhile, HeNRI prepares to turn on its super-collider, despite global protest against it. Now it's up to Julie/Annie to stop the collider and save the world!

Hong's fellow researcher Will contacts Dillon and he and Dan go to to meet him. he indicates that the Phi project is more deadly than any other weapon. He then attempts to explain just what Annie did at HENRI and how her research turned their world upside-down and culminates in the Phi suit. He explains phi is all around in nature as a mathematical construct and if you apply phi to maths and science instead of base 10 calculations the whole world opens up.

HENRI being a private contractor company sat on this until they had something they could sell and Ann's Alloy 618 was a breakthrough. It responds to organic energy and allows interface between atomic energy and organic organisms. Foster then cut funding until the department produced an armor with it for the army. The army refused the suit and instead decided to create a super-collider in Nevada using Alloy 618 in the hopes of making a sustainable black-hole. Having that technology would effectively end all wars.

She tried to complain and get a protest against the collider and when she got nowhere she ramped up work on the new beta suit and in a jet-pack trial she used the alloy suit to get it notice and her more credibility when she was murdered.

Its been raining for some time and Will gives Dillon a copy of all Annie's notes. He stays outside while the others go in. There is a Bang and blood drips to the floor and mingles with the rain.</Summary>
