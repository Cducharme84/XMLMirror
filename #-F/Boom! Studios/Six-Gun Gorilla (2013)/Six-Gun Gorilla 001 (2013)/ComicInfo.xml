  <Summary>Welcome to "the Blister" -- a bizarre other-world colonized by humans sometime in the 22nd century, which quickly became a hotly-contested source of fertile land and natural resources long ago exhausted on Earth. In this new frontier, a rogue gunslinger and his companion wander across a wilderness in the grips of a civil war, encountering lawlessness, natives, and perversions of civilization in a world at the crossroads between the past and the future. The fact that said gunslinger is a bio-surgically modified silverback gorilla toting a pair of enormous revolvers is neither here nor there.

Written by Simon Spurrier (Marvel's X-MEN LEGACY, EXTERMINATION) and drawn by hot new talent Jeff Stokely (FRAGGLE ROCK) and featuring a cover by Eisner Award-winning artist Ram&#243;n P&#233;rez (A TALE OF SAND, AvX: VS), SIX GUN GORILLA is a pulpy mash-up of Western weirdness and lo-fi science fiction unlike anything else on the stands! Ask your retailer about the variant incentive cover by James Harren (B.P.R.D.)!

Plot SummaryBlister is a planet full of natural resources that have run out on Earth. Therefore it has been colonised by humans. However rebel alliances have popped up over the years and there is a civil war raging. All this is broadcast back on Earth on a reality TV show. The footage for the show is captured by suicidal civilians who have agreed to appear on the show in exchange for their loved ones back home receiving a big payoff after they die. The catch is they can&#8217;t actually commit suicide but have to die while on a mission for the military. These civilians have cameras implanted in their eyes so everything they see, the public also see.

Blue 34-25 is one of these suicidal volunteers. His assignment on Blister is to be a messenger. On his way to deliver his first message Blue and the rest of the &#8220;volunteers&#8221; are attacked first by rebels and then by the monstrous wildlife &#8211; all with bloody consequences. Blue manages to escape and eventually comes across and old war hero whose dying request is for Blue to deliver a mysterious package to his wife. Watching through Blue&#8217;s eye-cam, the TV Network Executives immediately take an interest in the package and assign a sadistic hitman to track down Blue. All alone and scared, Blue decides to deliver the package but is again attacked&#8230; but this time he is rescued by a gun-totting gorilla.</Summary>
