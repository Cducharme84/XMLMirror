  <Summary>Love and Rockets X - Part Seven: The Love and Rockets band has broken up with all four members thinking they have dibs on that name for their respective future projects.

Poison River -- Part: Nine: Maria is caught between the jealous rage of both Fermin and Garza, with the former leaving physical marks on her and the latter kicking her out. Peter enlists the dogged Se√±or Pito to find Luba, and he does so, fulfilling his mission, then dying. Maria leaves Peter, whereabouts unknown. Gorgo tracks her down, but then lets her leave to California. Peter falls hard for pre-sex change Isobel, but then marries Luba after acting on Pito's information. Catching up to the early seventies, the postpartum Luba wakes up, still in the hospital, and finds Peter next to her, babbling and catatonic.

She wakes up and they make love with her taking initiative. Danita is forced back to her mom's place after finding Bumper's strip club abruptly shuttered. David shows other Hoppers kids a trash bag full of the milk carton sides with Hopey's image that Izzy had tossed out.
