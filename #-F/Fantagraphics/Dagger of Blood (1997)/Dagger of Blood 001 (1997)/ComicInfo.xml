  <Summary>River of Darkness: While Cort is in college, Coley, Harry, Kit &amp; Lon travel down the Amazon River to make a new film. But Harry has an ulterior motive. He explains how, while Coley was gone for months, he learned that a member of the Cult Of Shub Niggurath (see IDOL OF FLESH) helped save Coley's life and aided the demise of the half-human Garth. This cult member gave Harry an "enchanted" dagger and intended to lead him to the Temple, but was killed by other cult members first. Rather than wait for them to attack again, Harry's decided on a pre-emptive strike, of which most of his crew know nothing. In a jungle stream, Coley &amp; Kit have a very romantic &amp; intense "reunion". Watching the scene is Danny Navarro, a "guide" who Harry has really hired to be Coley's bodyguard. Coley, who earlier told Lon that "under the right circumstances, anyone can be had", winds up servicing Danny after Kit leaves, and tells him he knows before long Danny will return the favor. But as they talk, a cult member watches nearby.
