  <Summary>The Curse of Joquatoth: Unconscious for days, Coley awakes to find himself a prisoner of the cult. Beaten, he's told by Joquatoth that Danny was eaten by the cult members  and that the fate of Coley's friends now depends on him. Kit and Lon, meanwhile, have recovered from their seemingly-impossible sex-change operations, without even any scars and soon get busy with each other. Helmut has his way with Coley, then Joquatoth demands Coley choose between life with him as his lover or death for everyone. Coley reveals Joquatoth's horrible secret for all to see, apparently sealing their fates!

The Beast from Beyond: With both Coley and Lon strung up, Joquatoth uses the mystic dagger to call forth the demon Tuaarkha. As the monster ravishes Lon, Coley's new pet chews at his ropes, while a "transformed" Kit takes Harry as a cover for freeing him as well. Loose again, Coley engages Joquatoth in battle, as Kit and Harry escape. Stabbing Joquatoth seems to cause the nearby volcano to erupt, and Coley, Lon and his pet barely escape with their lives as the entire temple is engulfed in molten fire. As Harry tells Manuel, "Coley is very hard to kill."
