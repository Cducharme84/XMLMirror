  <Summary>Hardthrob, Part Two: As his new relationship develops &amp; deepens, Cortland tries to figure Coley out, but Harry tells him nobody can, nor should they. As time passes, Laura also becomes more heavily involved, as Coley's voodoo magnetism inspired them to act freer than they would on their own. Coley continues to seek adventure elsewhere, at one point hooking up again with Tommy, on another, with an evangelist who tells Coley he used to be gay, but changed, insisting Coley can as well. After a hot 3-way with him, Coley tells Cort, "At least he got my attention." Eventually, Laura tells Coley she feels he's no good for her brother, and asks Coley to let Cort go. But Coley tells Cort he never cared for her, only for Cort-- and finally admits, despite himself, that he does love Cort, and "wants him forever".
