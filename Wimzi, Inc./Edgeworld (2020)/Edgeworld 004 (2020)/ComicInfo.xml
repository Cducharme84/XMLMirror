  <Series>Edgeworld</Series>
  <Summary>A weird infestation is spreading around Rush, killing victims suddenly and painfully. Desperate to stop it before it becomes a plague, Killian and Cheela work together to find the cause and the cure. It seems to be spreading, rapidly and without reason, but how?

Edgeworld marks the surprise return to comics of Dreamworks television producer Chuck Austen, the controversial X-Men and Superman writer, partnering with his good friend, long-time Marvel/DC artist Patrick Olliffe.

In animation, Chuck has produced such impressive shows as Dawn of the Croods, She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, and Rocky and Bullwinkle for Dreamworks, and there isn't a character Patrick hasn't drawn for Marvel and DC, though he is most well-known for his work on Spider-Girl and Hawkman. Their shared creative vision brings to life a rich and complex world of characters and stories that marks Edgeworld out as a series not to be missed.

Chuck and Patrick are joined on this expectation-busting journey by outstanding colorist Lee Loughridge, talented designer/letterer Jodi Wynne, with edits from Bis Stringer Horne.
