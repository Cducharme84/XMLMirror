  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>This is a 6-page comic (plus front cover and frontmatter page) printed in black and white on yellow paper. It is a mini-comic, measuring 4.25x5.5".

Zot visits Jenny on her Earth but Godzilla shows up. Zot quickly defeats the monster.

They visit Max on Zot's Earth. He shows them a growth and shrinking formula he invented.

Dekko and Doctor Pweent break in. Peabody blasts at them but they zap him with a rust gun.

Cynicalman shows up to help. He wrestles with Pweent over the growth forumla and it accidentally splashes on Cynicalman, making him into a giant.

Cynicalman accidentally squishes Dekko and grabs Pweent. Godzilla shows back up (weirdly, since he was in Jenny's universe before) and Cynicalman shrinks him with the shrink potion. He also shrinks himself back to normal and Pweent into teeny size.

Jenny keeps Godzilla as a pet and Max puts Pweent into a jar for safety.</Summary>
