  <Summary>Zot's team arrives on Sirius. They are met by Prince Drufus's uncle Zarbim, who holds a very low opinion of Zot. However, he is at least interested in helping get the Key back for Sirius.

They are given a parade, but Jenny notices that the populace is unenthusiastic; Zot explains that it's basically a fascistic world where everyone's every move is controlled by the rules.

After Zot gives a speech, however, the people in the audience play a traditional song on their flutes, and Jenny sees how they are spiritually elevated by the sense of the music.

The team is bugged by the conspirators who want to start a war with Earth, but the find the bug. They meet with the king, who has Zarbim act as their guide. The conspirators, however, worry that the king is starting to get suspicious of them. They decide to hire 9-Jack-9 to kill him.

Zot and Drufus go to watch the Doorway at the Edge of the Universe. There is a long line of people trying to open it, as always, since it is the source of a well-known prophecy. Zot realizes one of the people in line is Vic in disguise. They give chase.

Jenny and Max talk about Zot's parents; Max is glad that Zot has Jenny as a friend.

Butch takes the lead for a while in chasing Vic, but loses him and is captured by a guard who thinks he's a normal ape.

Only Drufus is left chasing Vic. They get in air-cars and fly over the desert. Vic jumps into Drufus's car and they crash in the desert.

9-Jack-9 traps the king and kills him, making the unconscious Drufus the new King of Sirius.
