  <Summary>Zot barely avoids some bombs from Dr. Bellows, who surprised him by appearing on Jenny's Earth.

After some confused thoughts, Zot saves himself from a fall with his boot jets and flies back into the fight with cheer. He dodges some more attacks and seems to be doing alright when Bellows catches him in a bag.

The next morning, Butch and Jenny talk about Zot; Jenny again denies that he's her boyfriend. They complain about their absent parents. Jenny wonders if they'd let her move to Zot's Earth. Butch thinks Jenny is too serious about him and that he won't stick with her.

Terry and Jenny go to school. Jenny realizes she forgot to do her homework but manages to make it through the day. It's hard to concentrate when she's thinking about Zot.

Woody comes up again, but Jenny says that she has a boyfriend.

On the way home, Uncle Max opens a portal and drags Jenny into his Earth. He explains that Zot is fighting Bellows, who was from a planet with Victorian-era technology. Eventually they updated their tech, but Bellows didn't like it, and he became a villain.

Max brings Jenny to a park where Vic, Dirk, and Hacker are watching Zot fight like it's a movie. Jenny freaks out at how casually they watch--don't they realize he's in danger? Vic explains that as long as Zot thinks he can win, he will win. And he always wins, so he always thinks he can win. Zot does in fact win.

Jenny reminds him that they left Peabody turned off by the side of the road on her Earth, so they go get him. Then they hang out in Jenny's room listening to music, which Zot enjoys. He is confused about things like homework, which his Earth doesn't have. Jenny is constantly down about things in her Earth and wishes everything could be like Zot's. ZOt, however, thinks Jenny's Earth is great and she just doesn't see it.

He takes her up in the air, above the clouds, where a beautiful skyscape is visible. She admits it's beautiful.

Zot continues to visit. He helps her with her homework and takes her for tours of the area.

They go to visit Terry and see that a neighbor's house is on fire. The mother and one kid are out but another kid and the dad are still inside. Zot confidently flies inside to save them. He gets the kid and wants to go back inside but is stopped by flames at every angle. Then the house collapses; the father dies. Zot can't believe he was unable to save him--this sort of thing never happens on his Earth. He flies off in confusion and grief.

Jenny finds him and they talk. Zot asks why the bystanders didn't help when he was getting beaten up last issue. They discuss whether it was fear or whether it seemed like television to them. He considers whether he should come to this Earth after all. Jenny pleads with him to stay but also can't think of a reason why he should.

He has one reason: her. They kiss.

In "The Adventures of Zot in Dimension 10 &#189;!," chaos ensues as the Devoes visit Zot and Jenny; Cynicalman helps them with a solution.</Summary>
