  <Title>Looking for Crime; The Adventures of Zot! in Dimension 10 &#189;: Shakedown on Astro Speedway</Title>
  <Series>Zot!</Series>
  <Number>29</Number>
  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>The last issue focused on Jenny; this issue focuses on Zot. It continues the introduction to the "Earth Stories."

Zot and Jenny kiss. She thanks him for the nice fifteenth birthday. (This is a confusing timeline point, because Jenny mentions that she just turned 15 while she is in Zot's universe in issue 26, and this story can't have happened first since it takes place at least twelve days after the portal to Zot's dimension was lost.)

She says it's bedtime and they should go to their respective spaces, meaning he should go into his special pocket-dimension box. Once again, he invites her to see it, and once again she says no.

Inside, he makes some recordings for Max, should they ever meet again. He mentions how he's stuck in a cycle with Jenny, where she keeps wanting to see his box but never coming in. He isn't sure whether she'll choose him or Woody. He wants to sleep with her but knows she's not ready.

He mentions how he went into New York City the other day to stop some crime. He goes all over looking for crime but can't find any. He asks people where the crime is, and they clearly all describe it as being in some place they think poor people live, but they've never actually been to themselves.

He goes up to Harlem and they all laugh at him until he shows them he can fly, after which they all open up with opinions about where crime can be found, but none of it is really helpful. He does down into the subway but just seems homeless people. He begins to understand racism, which doesn't exist on his Earth, based on the patterns of how light and dark skinned people get on and off at different stops.

He hears someone yell for help, but can't find them. He begins to despair. Crime is so different here from his Earth, where criminals wear costumes and announce themselves.

He finds a homeless man who was stabbed on the subway and tries to help, but he's too heavy. He has to persuade a bystander to help. The bystander complains the whole time, but once they get the man to the hospital, he finally starts to feel good about doing good.

Zot wraps up his recording to Max by returning to the question of racism. He wonders if, in Jenny's universe, the South won the Civil War, since their racial values seem to have won out.

In "Shakedown on Astro Speedway," Zot and Jenny go flying in a jetcar that has been modified to have a voicebox. The car has a wacky personality and they have to find ways to keep it under control.</Summary>
