  <Title>Common Ground; The Magic Shop: Chapter One: September</Title>
  <Series>Zot!</Series>
  <Number>7</Number>
  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>Zot, Jenny, and the queen argue with Zarbim and his soldiers, who want to arrest them for the assassination of the king. The queen persuades Zarbim to talk with her privately for 5 minutes. At the end of the 5 minutes, she comes out, holding a gun to his head.

The queen actually persuaded Zarbim of the rightness of her argument but they decided it was better for him to look like a hostage in the eyes of his men and any conspirators who might be watching. They take off in a flyer with many soldiers in pursuit. Jenny and Zot shoot many of them down.

Zot and Jenny argue about whether Zot should go off on his own to find Bruce and deal with the situation. He thinks it's too dangerous for her but she wants to help. He finally agrees. The queen and Zarbim go to a monastery that the army would be blasphemous if they attacked it.

Zot and Jenny look for Bruce and Max. They fly over the lowest castes of society on Sirius, which are full of extreme poverty. Even Zot is shocked; it. turns out that he hasn't traveled as much as his publicists--which is to say, the initial splash page of the first issue of the series--have said.

The conspirators meet and threaten each other and their prisoners, spreading blame. Jenny and Zot break in and rescue Max, Vic's dad Raymond, the damaged Peabody, and a bureaucrat who helped them. They also go to the monastery.

The monks are happy to have them all. They already knew that the leader of the religion, Von Clokmann, was corrupt. They are also all safe in the monastery because there is no technology for 9-Jack-9 to transport in to.

When Zot tells Max about how 9-Jack-9 said he killed Zot's parents, Max believes it. It also explains Jack's name, which featured in a nursery rhyme Zot's mom used to sing; she seemed to know of him.

The queen apologizes to Zot for her husband hiring Jack, saying she had no control over the former king's policies. Zot won't listen. They learn of Prince Drufus's death. Vic has been captured and Von Clokmann has the Key.

Max finds a hidden undersea way out of the monastery and Zot leaves. He and Jenny grab the Key from Von Clokmann before he can use it to open the Doorway at the Edge of the Universe. While trying to escape with the Key, Zot accidentally takes them past the airlock that connects to the door, and the find themselves directly in front of it, with the Key that can open it.
