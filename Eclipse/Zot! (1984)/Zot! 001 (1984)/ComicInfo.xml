  <Summary>Thirteen-year-old Jenny Weaver and her family have just moved from Los Angeles and she is feeling bored and tired. Her reveries are interrupted by the flashy, flying, raygun-wielding Zot, who blasts a small army of robots who appear out of a portal.

He seems friendly, and she's looking for excitement, so she asks who he is. He comes from another Earth, and is trying to serve the cause of peace by stopping the robots, who are servants of the leaders of another world, Sirius IV. They are looking for a golden key that fits in the Doorway at the Edge of the Universe. Someone has stolen it, but even though the church caught the thief, they couldn't find the key. Now they're rampaging everywhere looking for it.

Jenny's annoying brother Butch finds the key and they bring it back to Zot's dimension, which turns out to be a Utopian-style Earth of 1965. Butch is annoyed to be there but Jenny is excited.

They bring the key to the authorities to settle the matter but it turns out Jenny has lost it. It doesn't matter, however, because a cult of radical de-evolutionists who also want the key smash their way in and start turning everyone into monkeys, including Butch.

Zot manages to defeat them and the council decides to put together a group effort to search for the key.</Summary>
