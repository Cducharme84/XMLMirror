  <Title>Getting to 99 Pt. 2; The Adventures of Zot! in Dimension 10 &#189; 20</Title>
  <Series>Zot!</Series>
  <Number>20</Number>
  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>Issues 19 and 20 were released at the same time. They are part one and two of the same story. They stand out from the rest of the series because McCloud wrote and did the breakdowns for them, but Chuck Austen did the art because McCloud was on his honeymoon.

Zot is in an underground city. He has to get to level 99 or a clock will blow the city up at noon. Zot is equipped with gear that has a limited number of charges so he has to use them carefully.

Zot had run into a tree at the end of the last issue. He wakes up, wondering how he can be in a park. Jenny tells him it's a hologram. He is worried he was knocked out too long but it was only a few minutes. He keeps flying down levels but now a flock of birds is following him, distracting him.

He eventually gets away from them and keeps on flying down. Zot runs into a bunch of dangerous robots but manages to recharge his bazooka so he can use a lot of shots to defeat them.

He continues to fly down. He goes past a school whose kids have been talking with Josh Hacker. The kids help stop some of the robots who are chasing him.

One of his boot rockets breaks so he has to run the rest of the way. Time is almost out. He gets to floor 99 but doesn't see the clock that he needs to shoot. One of the school kids tells Josh that there's actually a 100th floor. Zot uses a grenade to break through the floor.

Zot sees the clock and shoots it just in time. Inside, he finds a Dreep who made it accidentally malfunction. There was no sabotage after all.

In "The Adventures of Zot! in Dimension 10 &#189;," Zot and the Worker Unit from last issue fight. They distract it with some work, then cage it. They argue about what to do with it, but it escapes and flies into space.</Summary>
