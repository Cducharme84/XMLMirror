  <Summary>Max buys a different pie every year for New Year's. Zot and Jenny go to buy it. It is covered with cream so they can't tell which kind it is, and throughout the issue, everyone keeps trying to guess the flavor. (The pie is part of a gag that has been running in the letters pages, where readers could vote for which character would get hit in the face with a pie.)

Jenny complains about school; it's September in her world because time works differently there. She is now 15 and wants to permanently move to Zot's Earth. Zot is skeptical about the plan; he thinks her Earth is cool too.

They walk with the pie to Max's house. They run into Vic, who warns them that Bellows is coming. He attacks, but Zot and Floyd defeat him. Jenny remarks that Vic seems to be growing up. When Bellows returns to jail, he meets the Blotch.

Jenny, Vic, and Zot then see Digger, who was caught for driving without a license. The police release him since Zot vouches for him. Vic says he'll talk with Digger's dad about driving lessons.

Jenny and Zot go to Jenny's house to get some chips she bought.

9-Jack-9, Dekko, and Zybox are all in the same prison. Dekko is making a portrait of Jack. Jack and Zybox alter Dekko's records to have him remanded into Max's custody so his art will be seen outside of prison. They discuss the nature of the soul and Jack warns Dekko about Zybox.

While on Jenny's Earth, Zot and Jenny collect Butch, Woody, and Terry and bring them to the party at Max's. Terry doesn't really want to go but agrees in the end.

When they get there, Max tells Zot that Jack survived their last battle as a purely electronic signal. Jack will accompany Dekko to Max's for Dekko's new house arrest, but Jack will leave later.

Peabody has the pie. He starts making nonsense noises and Josh Hacker starts to fix him. A De-Evolutionary shows up and starts turning people into monkeys. However, he starts to cower when he sees Jack. Max takes Dekko to his room.

The Blotch and Bellows show up and announce that it's a robbery. Josh finishes fixing Peabody, but the repair makes Peabody launch the pie, straight into someone's face off panel.

In "Grounded," Peabody won't let Zot go see Jenny or stop crime unless his grades improve. He tries various strategies to get out of the house but they all fail until he breaks down and finally does his homework. He then solves all the crime and disasters on his world and goes to see Jenny.</Summary>
