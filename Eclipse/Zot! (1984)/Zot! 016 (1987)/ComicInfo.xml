  <Volume>1984</Volume>
  <Summary>Zot and his friends race to stop the De-Evolutionaries, who are threatening to devolve the President.

Zot makes light of the Devoes, while Butch, their former leader, amps up how tough they are.

Zot races into a planetarium, where the De-Evolutionaries are turning everyone into monkeys, including the President. Zot starts to fight them but they turn him into a monkey too.

The Devoes and the Grand Poo-Bah start doing a celebratory dance and song about going back to the trees.

When Vic, Josh, Dick, Jenny, and Butch arrive, the De-Evolutionaries turn them all into monkeys too, except for Butch, who is already a monkey. The Devoes run out, chanting. Butch follows, asking to join them, but they wack him on the head and leave.

Not being too smart, they accidentally walk right into the back of a police van and are brought to jail. However, their de-evolutionary ray guns are impounded by the police and can't be used to revert everyone to human form until the proper red tape is followed.

Most of the friends go to eat. Butch gets distracted by a wall of guns and then happens to walk past a room where Roger, a lieutenant in the police, is conspiring with another woman, Marsha, to kidnap the president, thereby making the chief of police look bad and take his job. Butch hears the plan, but Roger and Marsha see him and give chase.

Butch releases the De-Evolutionaries as he runs, making a distraction. he falls out of a window but lands in an air-bus.

Meanwhile Zot and Jenny, as chimps, ride a ferris wheel. Jenny is feeling down and asks if Zot finds her attractive. He hesitates, since she's a monkey, and she starts bawling. He says he does think she's beautiful.

Butch finds Vic, Josh, and Dick. They help hold Roger and Marsha at bay whole Zot shows up. Marsha and Roger run into a tent, where the Devoes find them. They put Obedience Masks on them, turning them into De-Evolutionary followers themselves, and fly off with them.

The rayguns are eventually released and everyone is turned back into a human. Roger and Marsha remain with the Devoes.

In The Adventures of Zot in Dimension 10 &#189;!, Woody asks Terry about Jenny and Zot. Zot crashes his bike into them and they and Jenny go riding together.</Summary>
