  <Summary>Butch has been captured by the army of de-evolutionists. They string him up and their leader rants about how he is the first perfect convert to their cult. They just need to control his mind with their special visor.

However, he resists and breaks out. Using his belt's forcefield, he is protected against their further attacks. Once he realizes that they think he's their savior, he starts getting ideas...

Von Clokmann has Vic as a prisoner but the other members of the church of Sirius are not all convinced he is as terrible as he has been made out to be. Floyd finds him and helps him escape, then Zot swoops in and flies him away to freedom. Jenny and Peabody are waiting; Peabody's damage is not as great as they had thought.

The conspirators continue to argue amongst each other, but the heroes have to stay incognito because many of the people of Sirius are still convinced that they broke holy law by going through the Doorway at the Edge of the Universe.

They all reunite at the monks' cathedral where it is blasphemous to attack them. Vic's dad is glad to see he is ok. Then Peabody shoots Vic in the back--he has been controlled by 9-Jack-9.

The heroes are all tied up and Von Clokmann prepares to kill them. Then Butch and his army of de-evolutionists attack! They turn many of the guards into monkeys. 9-Jack-9 applauds their creativity and tells Zot he has enjoyed this. Zot somewhat forgives him, saying he knows it was the king who gave the order to kill his parents. Jack teleports away, with him and Zot agreeing that they'll kill each other someday.

Vic is hurt but can be healed. Peabody is repaired.

The conspiracists continue to dwindle. One of them, Schrapp, has Jack kill Weavis, leaving only Schrapp left. He decides to use Zot's actions in going through the door as the excuse to attack Earth.

Adam Philips and Kurt Busiek credited as Consultants (for the ZOT story). There is a back-up feature with handbook-style entries for Dekko and Bellows.</Summary>
