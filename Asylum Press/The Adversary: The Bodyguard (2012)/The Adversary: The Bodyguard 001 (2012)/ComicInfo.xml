Michael sends her to put an end to the priest's abominations. But the priest has friends in low places that assign him a bodyguard, the bovine Belial. Yae-El comes for the priest and winds up battling Belial. She takes a beating but overcomes Belial with the use of her greatest power, he ability to channel the destructive force known as the Power Infernal.</Summary>
