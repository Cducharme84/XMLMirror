  <Summary>A bizarre orb unleashes a demon in Doctor Strange's Sanctum. But with Strange's powers on the fritz and Clea's soul removed from her body, the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man must take the case!

One Saturday night, Spider-Man is enjoying himself swinging across Washington Square. Soon he passes by Dr. Strange's Greenwich Village sanctum, and the mystic master sees him through a window. Strange wonders what brings Spider-Man into the neighborhood and calls out to him, but Spider-Man seems preoccupied and does not respond. Strange thinks Spider-Man's appearance is more than coincidence, for just this morning he received a deck of tarot cards by special delivery, with no return address. A few blocks away, Spider-Man finds an alley and changes into his street clothes, wondering why his spider-sense started to tingle. Near Abingdon Square, a few blocks away, Carol Danvers, editor of Woman magazine, disembarks from a bus. Soon the person behind these mysterious tarot cards will force these three together for a dark mystical adventure.</Summary>
