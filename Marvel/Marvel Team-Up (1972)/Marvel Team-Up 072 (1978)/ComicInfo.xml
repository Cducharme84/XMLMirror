  <Summary>Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Jean DeWolff. Wraith and Whiplash. Need we say more?

Spider-Man interrupts a Maggia robbery. Whiplash catches him off-guard though, and sends him to the hospital. Jean DeWolff summons Iron Man and the three of them track down the Maggia's location through a spider tracer that Spider-Man had slipped onto Whiplash's costume. However it turns out that the leader of this Maggia section is none other than The Wraith aka Brian DeWolff aka Jean DeWollf's brother! His mind power has driven him crazy and he uses his hypnosis on his sister in an attempt to make her kill herself. While Whiplash fights with Iron Man, Jean struggles to get her Brother nack in control of his mind. In the end, Brian snaps out of his state and stops Whiplash.</Summary>
