  <Summary>THE PHAROAH AND THE FORCE! Spider-Man along with members of the X-Men must fight alongside one another to stop the Living Pharoah who plans to use Havok as a human battery to amplify his powers.

In Muir Island Havoc and Lorna are attacked by some of Pharaoh's goons and Alex is kidnapped. Meanwhile in NY Spider-Man was still working in the Empire State University when he saw some strange guys stealing a box. He decides to follow them and find out Havoc arrested by the goons. Spider-Man releases him and they both defeat the goons. The the Pharaoh shows up, knocks down Spider-Man and again captures Havoc. He manages to hide Havoc forever away from the Sun, because they share the same power and they both uses the Sun to recharge, so with Havoc away, the power would be only his. At the end Spider-Man finds out the Pharaoh's hideout, but it could be too late.</Summary>
