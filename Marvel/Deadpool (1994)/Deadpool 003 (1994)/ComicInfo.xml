  <Summary>Black Tom wants Deadpool for his regenerative powers. Danny Peyer wants Deadpool for revenge. Deadpool just wants to be left alone. After avoiding one scrape after another, the Merc with a Mouth finally decides to take the fight to the source.

SynopsisDanny Peyer thinks he has Deadpool dead to rights. An Interpol striketeam has their guns pinned on Deadpool's head. What they don't know, however, is that the Juggernaut is still after Deadpool as well and comes charging out of the building and into Peyer's men. Peyer's men flee and Deadpool squares off with the Juggernaut. The fight doesn't last long, however, and Deadpool asks Siryn for help as he is getting choked. Siryn belts out a shriek and the Juggernaut has to let Deadpool go in light of a building falling on him. Despite her help, Deadpool tries to cast away Siryn.

Elsewhere, Black Tom receives a visitor: one of his men that failed to capture Deadpool. The man begs for his life in exchange for something he found after the fight. Black Tom and Dr. Killebrew look in the duffel bag and note its contents should be very helpful. Black Tom kills the man anyway.

In Danny Peyer's office, Banshee finds a file on Black Tom and realizes that Danny has been lying to him. He charges out to find Danny.

Despite Deadpool's desire to put as much distance between himself and Juggernaut as he can, Siryn stops him and the two have a heart-to-heart about the other's involvement with Black Tom. Siryn gets a little too chummy and tries to remove Deadpool's mask. Just then, Danny Peyer shows up and attacks. Siryn takes on the Interpol agents while Deadpool and Danny go at it. Deadpool gets shot up pretty good, but he also gets in a punch that knocks Danny off the building. (Danny is saved at that minutes by Banshee and roughly deposited in a dumpster.) With the fight over, Deadpool decides to bow out of the pursuit of Black Tom. His healing powers are just too inconsistent. Banshee and Siryn head off, but Wade changes his mind and Siryn comes back for him.

At Black Tom's hideout, Dr. Killebrew brainstorms how to use item in the duffel bag. Black Tom grabs a knife and cuts off his own hand. He pulls Deadpool's severed hand from the duffel bag and attaches it to his wrist.</Summary>
