  <Series>The Immortal Hulk</Series>
  <Summary>A random small-town tragedy. A mystery illness that spreads with grief. A green glow on a lonely mountain. Three puzzle pieces that fit together to make a nightmare. And the only mind on Earth than can connect them up...belongs to the Immortal Hulk.

Bruce Banner finds himself in a small unnamed town with an itch in the back of his brain and after eating at Buscema's Diner he wonders the town. He soon learns from the Turango Local Press that the town is experiencing mysterious deaths, and Bruce's itch tells him to investagate, so he starts asking questions.

Bruce soon learns from a friendly bartender and a friendlier drunk that the mysterious deaths started with Del Frye, one of the most loved teenagers in the town. Del was the prom king, star quarterback and son of rich doctor, but one day he just keeled over and died inexplicably.

Bruce takes a walk to Green Peak Cemetery to see Del's grave and there he senses Gamma Radiation coming for the dead boys grave. He calls the E.P.A. to warn them, going has far as telling them his name to get them to believe him. That works but instead of waiting for them Bruce climbs a mountain outside of town where he saw a green glow the night before.

Just before sun down he finds a small cave glowing green, inside he finds several corpses and a live glowing green Dr. Frye. The doctor attacks Bruce but the sun goes down and Hulk emerges. The doctor is in awe of the Hulk and explains his was using Gamma Radiation to try to prolong his life and it worked. He used himself as a test subject but when he tried it on Del, the teenage vomited green and died in his arms. The doctor for fear of the law, destroyed his work and claimed his sons death an accident.

Later, Doctor Fyre started noticing his body glowing green from the Gamma Radiation and retreated to the cave where he would kill anyone who found him. He only wanted to live in peace. Hulk then explain to the Doctor that his son's corpse was killing people in the town and he would have to pay for his crimes.

The Hulk then ripped off the Dr. Frye's limbs and buried him in rumble under the mountain and due to the Gamma Radiation, the Doctor survived but was now trapped forever in his new prison. Meanwhile in town the EPA arrives and digs up Del grave to find him glowing green as well.
