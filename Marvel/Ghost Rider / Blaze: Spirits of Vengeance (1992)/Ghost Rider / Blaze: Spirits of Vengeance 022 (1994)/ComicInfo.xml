  <Summary>The Children: Uncontrollable mystical energies burst forth from Miranda Woods when her grief over her missing son Timmy overwhelms her.  John manages to calm her down but doesn't know what to do about Timmy.  Clara tells him that she may sense him in New York but she's not sure.  She sends him to Child Inc. as the place to start.  When John tries talking to them he is getting nowhere when Cardiac interupts by attacking the organization claiming that they are not using the funds given to them to help children.  John tries to stop him but gets shot in the face and then kicked out of the building for trespassing after Cardiac leaves.  John goes to Dan Badilino (Vengeance) for help.  He reluctantly agrees and when he and John begin their stakeout there is an explosion so Dan transforms to Vengeance and they both ride to the roof.  They find Cardiac there and the three of them go down to the sub-basement where they are attacked by robots.  They discover that Child Inc. has been selling children and John finds Timmy being held there.  Cardiac completely destroys the building and John is able to reunite Timmy with his mother.
