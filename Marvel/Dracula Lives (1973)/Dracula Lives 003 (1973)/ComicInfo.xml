The Vampire-Man: This story postulates the Jack the Ripper killings were done by a hateful hunchback who wanted to become a vampire so he could kill mortals, but was repulsed by the sight of blood, so vampires killed him when he could not fulfill their condition that he partake of human blood before new year's eve.

Kane kills her and then turns to Count Dracula. He defeats the Count in a duel, but bound by his honor, Kane is forced to spare Dracula's life when the vampire calls in a favor for saving him from the wolves earlier.
