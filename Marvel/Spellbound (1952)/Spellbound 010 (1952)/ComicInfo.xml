When Grugg Goes to Sleep!: This story asserts that you are an alien who has to look into a mirror when you read this story.

The Living Mummy: When a man brings a mummy back to life, the mummy kills him in order to wrap up the body and substitute it back in the museum exhibit.

How Many Times Can You Die???: A man is double-crossed by his partner-in-fraud who leaves the police a note framing him for murder by the riverside. Their deal was to fake a suicide, but the partner decided to take all the money and frame the fall guy. The man gets out of the stir and guns down his old partner figuring they can't put him on trial for killing the same man twice, but since the man was living under a new identity, they try him for killing a separate person and send him to the gas chamber.
