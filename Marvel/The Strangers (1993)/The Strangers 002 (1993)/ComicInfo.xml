  <Summary>The six strangers that banded together take a plane into the air of San Francisco to chase after a mysterious woman they all fought previously. They finally find her in the only cloud that hovers in the sky and find that there is an island hidden in the cloud that houses a total tribe. While there, the group learn that the mysterious woman, Yrial, had nothing to do with the lightning bolt that gave them their powers. As a matter of fact, Yrial defied her tribe and went to San Francisco to investigate the phenomenon. The tribal chief decided that Yrial should continue to find the source of the lightning bolt that imbued everyone with abilities and decrees that she goes with the team to be a witness to the answer. The team call themselves the Strangers and figure out what to do next. 

Meanwhile, the driver of the Miata that was struck with the cable car is still in critical condition and surprisingly still alive. Also, J.D. Hunt, a rich and ruthless business man who created the android, ElectroCute, that gained sentience during the cable car accident and joined the Strangers, makes devious plans to get her back.</Summary>
