  <Summary>We Are the 3 Who Vanished!: Three scientists disappear without a trace, leaving a journal explaining that they were working on a time machine. The police never know what happened, because the time machine succeeded, but transformed the three men into three seventeenth-century scientists thinking about a time machine, unaware of their true identities.

I Couldn't Stop the Runaway Comet!: In the year 2060 a vain elected official feels that the forces of science will be sufficient to deal with the menace of an impending comet but everything they try to either destroy or divert the comet fails. Finally all humanity, including the official, turn to prayer, and the comet is swept aside from its collision course with Earth.

I Am...Gorilla!: An atomic explosion makes a gorilla as intelligent as a human. It is overjoyed, and plans to conquer mankind or to teach humans through dialogue, but its artificial intelligence quickly dissipates.

Don't Send Me...Out There!!!: A space pilot is terrified of taking another flight but his family is unsympathetic. Their attitude is out of surprise, since a robot has never before been afraid.

They Call Me...Space Pirate: A successful space pirate tries to conquer a world without technology to use as a base. He is surprised to find that the inhabitants are actually advanced "homo superior" with psychic powers, and they easily imprison him and his men.
