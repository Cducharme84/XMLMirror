  <Summary>Tracy Lawless continues his relentless hunt for the truth about his brother's murder, as he sinks deeper and deeper into the criminal world his little brother lived and died in. Now, as he learns more about the man his brother Rick had grown up into, and as he becomes close to the woman who loved his brother, he realizes that someone in the city has figured out who he really is, and that could mean big trouble. All this, and the Christmas Eve heist to end them all falls into place! From the acclaimed and award-winning team of Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips. And remember, every issue of CRIMINAL is packed from cover to cover with content, from back-up stories to noir articles by Brubaker and many other big-name writers.</Summary>
