  <Genre>Horror-suspense</Genre>
  <Summary>Don't Try to Outsmart the Devil!: An evil man makes a bargain with Satan that his heart will never stop beating so that he will live forever, but Satan merely arranges it so that his heart continues to beat after his body has rotted away.

The Visitor: A man is convinced that controlling visitors exist all around him and when he is confronted by mist he goes off his rocker.

The Hands of Death: A woman's car breaks down in an area where women have been strangled and she takes shelter in a nearby house. She is admitted by a bundled figure that she abruptly assumes is the strangler. She screams, and another man breaks in the door, but the new man on the scene is actually the stranger. The bundled person tosses aside his disguise and kills the strangler, apologizes to the woman for frightening her, and explains that the strangler had murdered his wife and so he had disguised himself as bait.

The Man Who Talked to Rats: A man comes across a man who talks to rats in an alley and makes a deal with him to kill his uncle so he will inherit his money. The weird guy sends his rats into the estate to chew up the old guy and the nephew both.
