  <Summary>A man discovers a type of werelizard that reproduces its kind by injecting humans with a poison in its bite that transforms their bodies.

A man tries to kill himself over and over again but only succeeds in producing pain and mutilation, not the longed for oblivion. A friend of his informs him that he is already dead, for he committed suicide a year ago, and has been sent to Hell where all suicides reside.

A criminal in a bar at night sees a stranger doing wondrous things and so he pulls a gun and demands to know how they are done. The stranger says that if he wants these powers all he needs to do is agree to exchange places with him. He does so and commits various crimes with his new powers, but once the morning begins to arrive, he feels drawn to a cemetery and realizes that he has exchanged places with a ghost.</Summary>
