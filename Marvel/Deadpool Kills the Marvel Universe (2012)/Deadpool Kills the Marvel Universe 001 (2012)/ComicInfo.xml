  <Summary>SynopsisWhat if everything you thought was funny about Deadpool&#8230;was actually just disturbing?

What if he decided to kill everyone and everything that makes up the Marvel Universe?

What if he actually pulled it off? Would that be FUN for you?

The Merc with a Mouth takes a turn for the twisted in a weekly horror comic like no other&#8230;

PlotThe story begins with Uatu the Watcher explaining to the reader who he is and what he has witnessed, some universes with good things happening and others filled with terror.

Susan Storm is at the Baxter Building and screaming after finding her husband, Reed Richards, stretched to what seems to be beyond his limits, his body laying limp all around his lab. Reed tells her that a man has stolen something and destroyed Ben, when she remembers Frank and Valeria. Reed explains that the man cannot touch them, and he sent them to the Negative Zone.

Susan goes invisible and runs into another room in the Baxter Building to find Deadpool on the Fantasicar and Johnny under it. Deadpool beheads the Human Torch and the blood splatters on Invisible Woman, making her visible. Deadpool taunts her and she uses her telekinetic abilities to explode his head. He heals almost immediately and stabs her with a sword.

Uatu, addresses the reader once more and tells them the back story. The X-Men and Professor Xavier escort Deadpool to a Ravencroft Sanitarium where a Psycho -Man, in disguise as head of the sanitarium, assures that Wade would be in good hands and his treatments are the best there is. During a one-on-one therapy session, Psycho-Man attempts to brainwash Deadpool to become his first member of a team of brain-washed super-villains to take over the world.

Deadpool, however, overcomes this and breaks the robot body and retrieves from the head a tiny Psycho-Man whom he bashes on the head several times on a document allowing Deadpool to be released. Deadpool has a new voice in his head and asks it what happened to the other two. It replies that he doesn't need them anymore. And he was hungry. It also says that he already killed one super- human and to finish the job.

As he walks through the hallway, a large number of patients beg him to let them out. Instead, he kills the guards, and blows them up along with the facility.

We return to the present and the Watcher is in the Baxter Building. While he is talking about how this began the start of a murderous journey, a mask-less Deadpool renders him useless with a Cosmic Taser from Mister Fantastic's laboratory. Deadpool asks who he was talking to and warns the "peeping- toms in Never-land" to watch out and beheads Uatu.</Summary>
