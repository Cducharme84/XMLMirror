  <Summary>Look Homeward, Werewolf!: A werewolf hires a boatman to get him across the river but warns the man that water causes a violent reaction among his kind and if a single drop touch him, his life is forfeit. The boatman agrees, as he claims to be the best boatman for miles around and will have no problem keeping the werewolf dry. They cross the river without incident, but then it starts to...rain.

Ask Me No Questions: A father thinks his son asks him silly questions and so he gives him silly answers which annoys his mother. When the boy asks him where he came from, the father replies "The stork brought you." The boy asks "How did the stork know where to bring me?" The father replies "I blew my magic whistle" (which is a hunter's moose horn). The boy takes the horn outside and blows it and when the father goes to retrieve it, he sees dozens of storks delivering dozens of babies.

Smile, Blast Ya, Smile: An editor for a science fiction publication is in danger of losing his job to a man who always smiles. The boss likes his story picks and so do the readers. When circulation rises the editor is fired and turns to drink. He attacks his former assistant with a knife, shredding the smiling mask, revealing the alien underneath. No one believes him and he is placed in an asylum.

The Man Who Made a Wish!: A man makes a pact with Satan for money and Satan gives him a disease that the medical community will pay him 10,000 dollars to partake in their study, but the disease will ensure that he will only have one month of life to spend the money.

Deep Grave.  Cold Grave!: A homeless man receives a ragged old coat with pockets full of cash, but the cash disappears if he removes the coat, so everyone thinks he must have stolen the money, and won't accept it.
