When he returns to the inn, the ghosts of his former victims are now able to seize his body as he is unaware that what he took for lightning and thunder was the bottle exploding in his hand and he is now a ghost.

Death and Tommy Norton: A boy's toy soldier shoots his aunt when she attempts to murder him.

The Man Who Saw Tomorrow: A man who invents a camera that can photograph the future is terrified when he sets it to a week in advance and produces a...blank photo.

The Twin!: In eighteenth-century France, twin brothers are always competing with each other but the one who was born first always thinks of ideas slightly before the other. The later brother decides he's had enough and is going to murder the first born twin, but yet again, he gets the idea just a little slower than the other man.
