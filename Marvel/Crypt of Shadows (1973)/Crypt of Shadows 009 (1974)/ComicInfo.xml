  <Summary>The Haunting of Sleepy Hollow!: A man tries to get rid of his rival by frightening him as the Headless Horseman, but the other guy has the same idea and succeeds in getting his rival committed to an asylum. The real Headless Horseman shows up to punish him.

Tomorrow!: A man is offered a job by a strange organization that gives him glasses that can see 24 hours into the future, and he must report all accidents he sees so that they can be averted. When he fails to report one because of a personal grudge, he nearly seals his own doom.

Half-Man!: Androids are subject to discrimination until a war with space aliens breaks out and then they gain some measure of equality. One of them even plans to marry a human girl if he survives the conflict, but when the war is won, the androids find the old barriers have been put back in place. When the android sees his intended sweetheart on the street, she pretends not to know him.

Beyond Death!: In order to prevent a man from marrying his daughter, the father tries to inject him with a serum that will turn him to stone. The intended victim succeeds in disarming the father and climbs up to the man's room to give him a taste of his own medicine. But, unknown to him, the daughter has exchanged places with her father because he complained of a draft, and he turns her to stone.
