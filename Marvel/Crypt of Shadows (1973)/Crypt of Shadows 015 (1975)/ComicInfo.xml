  <Summary>My Coffin Is Crowded: A convict makes a deal with a man that, in exchange for half the stolen loot, he will dig him up if he climbs into a marked coffin with a recently deceased inmate. The ruse works, and he is buried, but hours go by and no one comes to dig him up. He lights a match and sees that the body next to him is the man who was supposed to dig him up.

I Know the Power of... the Genie!: A little girl summons a genie to punish adults after she is spanked. The genie eventually erases all people, but the girl gets lonely and asks him to bring them back, which he does, before leaving forever.

The Swami's Secret!: A mind-reading swami is undone when he comes across an individual he believes is an alien preparing to invade. He signs a confession to the police that he has been swindling wealthy clients for years but thinks the occasion is important enough to reveal his secret ability. The police check his story, but it turns out that 'alien' is an actor preparing a role.

The Man Who Sold His Soul!: A witch betrays a man whose greatest desire is to fight in the ring by transforming him into the bull.
