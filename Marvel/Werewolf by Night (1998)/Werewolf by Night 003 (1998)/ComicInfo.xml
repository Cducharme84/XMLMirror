	<Summary>In a run-down shack in a gator infested area of the Everglades, an aged lupine Jack Russell sits, as a hunter bursts in. The hunter aims his rifle at Jack's head, and Jack begins the tale of how he ended up there. Years before, at a carnival, Jack took a ride in a fun-house that was supposed to take him on a journey into himself. The ride ended with Jack scared witless, and when his girlfriend Roxanna approached, he attacked and slashed her. No longer human, he then went on the run, hiding in the sewers, making victims of innocents who had the misfortune of crossing his path. When he felt the heat closing in on him, Jack made his way to the swamps of Florida.

The hunter then tells Jack he there to exact vengeance in the name of his daughter, one of Jack's victims. Jack lets the hunter shoot him.

Jack then wakes up in the present in the fun-house car; his horrifying future was all an illusion. Feeling ill, he topples out onto the ground, then looks up at the nameplate screwed onto the side of the car. Jack realizes it is of the same metal as the Wolfblade, and is indeed the second of the three pieces he seeks. He again enters the fun-house on foot.
