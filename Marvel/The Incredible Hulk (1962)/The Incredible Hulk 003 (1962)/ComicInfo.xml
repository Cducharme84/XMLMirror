  <Summary>Banished to Outer Space: The military captures Rick and Ross convinces him that they need the Hulk to test a new experimental rocket for national security. Rick tricks the jade giant into the capsule but once it is shot into space, he realizes that Ross deceived him to get rid of his foe. Rick overrides the programming and returns the rocket to earth but not before Banner (he transformed back to his human form when the rocket came into view of the sun) is doused with further radiation. The Hulk is now unable to revert to his human form and is under Rick's control but only while Rick remains awake.

The Origin of the Hulk!: With the Hulk safely in the underground bunker, Rick dozes and thinks about his origins.

The Ringmaster: Rick takes a break from his Hulk-sitting duties and goes to the circus. Unfortunately, he picks one run by a hypnotic criminal who mesmerizes his audience and then robs them. When the Hulk arrives to bail out his buddy, he is captured and made part of the act thanks to the fact that Rick is in thrall and cannot give him any commands. Rick returns with the FBI and the Hulk finds himself free to kick some circus tail.
