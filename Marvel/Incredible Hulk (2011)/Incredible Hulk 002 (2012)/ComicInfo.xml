  <Summary>The Hulk and Bruce Banner are now separate entities but still at odds with one another. The Hulk has been assigned to take Banner down...but Bruce isn't going without a fight.

Some Issue Highlights:

Banner's split is still taking a toll, driving his sanity and everyone he loves away.
Betty learns the unfortunate truth of her and Bruce's "vacation" to a deserted island.
Banner's subjects are still searching for the perfect specimen.
Amanda Von Doom keeps pestering the Hulk for assistance, and introduces him to the "Mad Squad" (Mister Gor, B.R.A.I.N and many Killer Robots).
Amanda, her Mad Squad and Hulk take an unwanted swim with some very disgruntled sea creatures.
Hulk gets mad , leaving Amanda and her Mad Squad wanting.
Banner's subjects are sent to kill Hulk and everything Hulk loves (Moloids). - which is the reason for the Next Issue's eerie cover:
