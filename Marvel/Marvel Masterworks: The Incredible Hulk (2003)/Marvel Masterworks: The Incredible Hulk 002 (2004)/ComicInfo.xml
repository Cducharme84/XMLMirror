  <Series>Marvel Masterworks: The Incredible Hulk</Series>
  <Summary>The Titan and the Torment: Zaxon tries to sap the power of the Hulk for his own nefarious ends but ends up getting himself killed in the process. Free once again, the Hulk rips up some train tracks to throw at pesky fighter jets and wouldn't you know that Hercules just happens to be riding in the oncoming locomotive. Hulk and Herc battle to a standstill before the jade giant leaps off to fight another day.

The Hulk Must Die!: The Hulk returns from the future and is promptly captured by the military. Rick spills the secret to Betty that Bruce and the Hulk are one and the same and she tries to come to grips with that fact. Banner's replacement at gamma base, Dr. Zaxon, plans to use the power of the Hulk to fuel his own bid for world conquest.

Bruce Banner Is the Hulk!: The Hulk and the Executioner battle for the fate of the future earth and once the Asgardian is defeated, the Hulk returns back to his own time. Hounded by the military and thinking that Banner and the Hulk are dead, Rick tells Talbot the secret of the Hulk's alter ego.

I, Against a World!: The Hulk has been zapped into the future by the t-gun and fights with King Arrkam's forces before he is finally overcome. Once he regains consciousness, Arrkam asks his help in fighting "The Evil One" who turns out to be none other than the Executioner.

Not All My Power Can Save Me!: With the Leader dead, the Hulk uses the Watcher's ultimate machine on himself and its only effect is to let him know that Rick has once again been captured by the military so they can learn the connection between Bruce Banner and the Hulk. Leaping to the rescue, Hulk is zapped by the t-gun which propels him into the future.

The Wisdom of the Watcher!: The Hulk fights the baddest alien in the galaxy over the Watcher's ultimate machine. After the battle, the Watcher allows Hulk to take it and he is teleported back to the Leader's lair. The Leader tries to use the machine which dispenses all of the Watcher's collected knowledge but even his big brain can't handle it and the strain kills him.

Another World, Another Foe!: Discovering the bullet that is lodged in the Hulk's brain, the Leader dissolves it with a laser and bathes our hero with gamma rays to give him strength. The Hulk still has Banner's mind but can no longer transform into human form thanks to the extra blast of radiation. Indebted to the Leader for saving his life, the Hulk agrees to be teleported to the Watcher's planet where he has been commanded to steal the "ultimate machine" but finds that said machine is also sought by the most powerful creature in the galaxy.

Within the Monster Dwells a Man!: The Hulk finally agrees to follow the Leader and the big brained one teleports him out just as Ross destroys Banner's old underground complex. The Leader and the Hulk get to know each other a little better but the jade giant struggles with trying not to change back to Banner as he is still plagued with a bullet in his head that would kill his alter ego.

Like a Beast at Bay!: The Hulk and Rick barely make it out of the blast radius as Ross fires the giant "Sunday Punch" missile at the Leader's giant Humanoid bringing the massive robot down. The pair decide to hide in their underground cave but are spotted by military planes as they enter. Ross and Talbot attack, threatening the underground complex and Bruce's gamma machine. The Hulk pushes Rick out to safety just as the Leader appears and tells the Jade Giant he will save him from his sticky predicament if only he agrees to serve the big brained bad guy.

To Live Again!: Dragging his dead buddy to their old underground complex, Rick uses the gamma machine on Bruce, thus turning him into the Hulk and saving his life. The Hulk once again has the intellect of Banner but he has to continue to use the ray machine every 48 hours to keep himself from turning into his alter ego as he still has a bullet lodged in his head. Talbot makes a bid for Betty now that his arch rival has been killed in disgrace. The Leader sends a giant Humanoid to attack gamma base and the Hulk gets involved in the fight.

Trapped in the Lair of the Leader!: The Leader makes off with the Hulk and the absorbatron but the jade giant ends up destroying the machine to keep it out of the Leader's hands. Convinced that Banner is still a traitor and despite his orders, Talbot authorizes his men to use deadly force and Bruce is killed by a bullet through the head.

Back from the Dead!: Saving Talbot and himself from plunging to their deaths, the Hulk decides he is tired of world travel and leaps home. Waking up in gamma base, Bruce is once again jailed as a traitor and the president once again sets him free (Rick told the commander in chief the secret of the Hulk a few issues ago). Banner and Talbot are once again sent to Astra Island to continue a test of the absorbatron but the leader sends an army of Humanoids who finally succeed in capturing the Hulk.

Where Strides the Behemoth: The Hulk beats on the Russians bad enough that when he decides to leap away, they don't try to stop him. Jumping all the way to the Himalayas, the Hulk is finally tired out and transforms to Banner just in time to be menaced by a local bandit chieftain. Talbot catches up with Bruce in this hairy predicament and when their captors are attacked by a rival band of raiders, Bruce and Glenn fall off a cliff to their death?

The Power of Dr. Banner!: The Hulk escapes from his Russian captors with a fellow fugitive who gives his life to save the jade giant from a blast from the powerful proton gun. Angry at the death of his friend, Hulk decides to take his fight to the commies.

On the Rampage against the Reds!: In a pitched battle with the Humanoids, the Hulk and his foes fall into the ocean where the jade giant transforms back into Banner and is promptly captured by a Russian sub. Bruce is told he will be forced to work for the commies but instead he turns back into the Hulk and escapes. The Russians chase him down with a proton gun.

The Horde of Humanoids!: Banner has been jailed as a traitor and is popping tranquilizers to keep himself from turning into the Hulk. Rick goes right to the commander in chief to tell the prez Banner's secret and to ask for his release. Much to Talbot's chagrin, the president orders Bruce's release and the two are sent to Astra Island to oversee testing of Banner's absorbatron which has the power to soak up a nuclear blast. Figuring that one Humanoid was not enough, the Leader sends a horde of them to Astra where they battle with the Hulk.

A Titan Rides the Train: The Leader ponders his origins as he prepares to send his powerful Humanoid to confront the Hulk. Although he is under suspicion for being in collusin with the Hulk, Banner is sent by train to escort one of his nuclear devices with Talbot keeping a close eye on him. The Humanoid attacks the train and Hulk fights the creature off. The nuclear device falls off the train in the skirmish and when Talbot goes to retrieve it, he finds Banner next to it in nothing but a pair of ripped pants. Bruce is jailed as a traitor.

Enter...the Chameleon!: The Hulk is captured in unbreakable restraints but slips through them when he turns back into Banner. Hearing that his buddy has been captured, Rick leaves Cap's side to go help his original super pal. The mysterious Leader sends the Chameleon to gamma base to find out what happened to an agent who didn't report back in (probably because he ended up falling down a hole in a robot suit last ish). Talbot and Banner begin their less than friendly rivalry. The Chameleon impersonates Banner and tries to steal a gamma grenade using Betty as a hostage but the Hulk thwarts his plans.

Captured at Last: The Hulk takes on the indestructible Banner-created robot and succeeds in kicking him down a bottomless hole when he realizes that he cannot beat the machine. Glenn Talbot arrives on gamma base sent by the Pentagon to keep an eye on the suspicious activity of Bruce Banner. Glenn decides that keeping an eye on Betty seems like a good idea as well. The Hulk is felled while saving Gamma Base from a missile and Ross captures him in a special restraint built by Bruce Banner based on a design by Tony Stark.

The Incredible Hulk: Bruce creates an indestructible robot which is able to withstand the power of a nuclear blast but the stress of completing it on schedule causes him to transform into the Hulk and he leaves this massive weapon of awesome power unattended. A foreign spy who has been hanging around jumps into the robot and takes off. The Hulk tries to stop the robot but can't and once he is worn out from the battle, he transforms back into Banner. Found lying in the desert by Ross and Betty, Bruce vows to build a bigger and better robot to take down the first one.

Enter: The Hulk: Giant-Man goes out to New Mexico to try and capture the Hulk.
