  <Summary>Aircel's comic adaptation of Carmilla is loosely based on J. Sheridan Le Fanu's 1872 novella. The first book in the volume is the most true to Le Fanu's original plot. Arguably the Ur-mother of the lesbian vampire, Carmilla is portrayed as a predatory and devious figure that feigns vulnerability to infiltrate the home of the young protagonist Sarah (originally named Laura in the novella).

The story begins with Carmilla paying a late night visit to Sarah as a young girl, which she then attributes to a dream despite the evidence of a vampire bite. The interlude then unapologetically shows a sapphic sex-scene with Carmilla/Millarca and another woman. Following the interlude, the narrative returns to Le Fanu's original plot with the news that Mademoiselle Rheinfeldt, who was due to pay the protagonist a visit with her guardian, has been killed by a "monster." Sarah's vows to search for this monster are then interrupted by a carriage accident, in which a mysterious young woman is supposedly injured. Sarah then convinces her father Tobias to take in the seemingly vulnerable young lady so she may recover.

Following a visit from the doctor, Sarah requests that she be allowed to see the young lady. The protagonist then recognises the mysterious house guest as the figure from her 'dream' all those years ago. Before she can reveal this, however, Carmilla cunningly appropriates the details of the encounter and deceives Sarah into believing she shared the same 'dream.' Having gained the protagonist's trust through these falsified claims, Carmilla attempts to get closer to her and a close bond begins to develop between the pair. The issue then ends with a voyeuristic scene, in which the vampire watches the young woman undress through the window. It is then ambiguously implied that the vampiric exchange that follows may also be a sexual one. Whilst the lesbian undertones are certainly present in Le Fanu's novella, the Aircel adaptation unapologetically and explicitly portrays the vampire's homosexuality.</Summary>
