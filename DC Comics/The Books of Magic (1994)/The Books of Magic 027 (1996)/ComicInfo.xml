  <Summary>Cupid and Psyche are in San Francisco.  They have adopted new over-the-top hip-hop looks and personas, calling themselves Q and Fly Kee.

Meanwhile, two suburban white kids, Oscar and Herschel, who are also wanna-be gangstas who are going to work with Q, pass by Tim, Leah, and the other models in their van.  Leah kisses Tim to make them jealous, and the two kids crash into a billboard of Leah's while they're distracted.

Tim is taken aback as well, and they discuss how much bigger America is than England, and Leah's old prison of a box.

Tim is attracted to Leah, but is thinking more about Molly, and what she's doing.  Leah realizes this, and even defends Tim from the other girls, saying that she likes Molly and they need to back off.  Her own crush on Tim, however, is equally clear.

Molly, meanwhile, is in faerie, having been brought there after her bet with the Amadan.  People have been trying to trick her into being stuck there, but an elf named Selwyn brings her food in the name of Auberon--food that was purchased in the real world, and thus can be eaten without her being stuck in faerie.  She is now just waiting for the contest with Amadan.

Herschel and Oscar finally make it to Q's pad, where he has been making special chocolate hollowpoint bullets for his Z70B gun.  They tell him and Psyche that they want revenge on the models, and Q is up for it.

Selwyn advises Molly against playing with Amadan, but Molly sees through her disguise, and Selwyn reveals herself to be Auberon.  He asks her to be his new fool, taking Amadan's place.  He believes that she has a better grasp of the truth of things, and could help the faeries see themselves more truly.  If she agrees, she can ask for a favor.

At the models' agency, Cupid breaks in and sprays down everyone with his love bullets, including Tim and Leah.
