  <Summary>Araquel and Tim argue with Vasuki over the demons plan to take over the Earth. Araquel slashes Vasuki into four pieces.

One of Cyril's four toy horsemen of the apocalypse, "Inconvenience," aka a male Lacey doll named Ben, goes a bit rogue and torches the apartment, which explodes, killing Cyril.

Circe is starting to get annoyed at Slaggingham's constant rhetoric about the apocalypse, and decides to use her patented tools to change him. Just then, they see the apartment explode.

Tim and Araquel talk about angelic nature--Araquel argues that the one constant of angels is that they can only be who they are, and have no choice, unlike humans--and Tim wrestles with what his dad, in monster form, has done. Araquel says Bill wasn't powerful enough to have killed all the angels.

Vasuki, now in four separate smaller bodies, comes back alive. They see Tim's dad, about to attack a group of nuns.  Vasuki says that Tim must agree to serve the Queen of Wounds to keep his dad from killing them. Tim agrees.

A woman with a halo of stars, and held aloft by black balloons, brings Cyril back to life. Slaggingham, watching, calls her the Devil. He says God's balloons are white, and we see some nearby.

Meanwhile, a nun with balloons, whose color we can't see but may be the white balloons, is confronted by Bill-as-monster. Vasuki refers to her as the Queen of Wounds. Bill stabs at her chest, but her power transforms him back to a human.

The Queen throws Tim a list and says he must accomplish them in seven days, then floats away.

Cyril shows up and turns Araquel, Bill, and the Vasukis to chocolate.

Tim and Cyril argue. Cyril admits that when he was dead, he went to hell, contrary to his expectations. His awareness of this turns him back to normal, and he loses his halo.

Tim tells the nun, who now definitely has black balloons, that he will do what she wants if she turns all his friends back to normal.
