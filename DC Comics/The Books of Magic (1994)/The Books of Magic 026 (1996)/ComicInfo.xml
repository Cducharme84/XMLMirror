  <Summary>Tim wanders around London, still determined to avoid his family and friends so as to keep them from harm--and of course he also thinks they mostly reject him now.

He passes out in an alley from lack of food.

The Wobbly (last seen in issue 14) shows up and intends to collect him, thinking he has thrown away himself, but Kenny (last seen in the first issue) shows up and stops him, saying that Tim is actually on the road.

We next see Kenny visiting the waitress (last seen in Arcana Annual 1) to get some food for Tim.  He's been caring for Tim for a while.  Kenny watches as Tim sleeps, and his tattoos transform into living animals and attack each other.  Kenny wakes Tim up, and the tattoos (which Kenny calls maps) continue to battle.

The scorpion tries to sting the butterfly but hits the lit candle and burns up.  The butterfly comes back and Tim slaps it into a new, smaller location on his arm.  Kenny admonishes Tim for letting Circe put them on him in the first place, but also says Tim is not ready to let go of the butterfly.

Kenny then tells Tim he can take any one thing from his knapsack, which turns out to have tickets to locations all over the world.

Tim decides to go to San Francisco to see Zatanna.  Arriving in the airport, he is already amazed at American customs and sights when he runs into Leah, the succubus he freed (last seen in issue 8).  She's now a teen model, touring around with a van full of other teen models.

She gets Tim to jump in, and they all ride off.  Leah is not unhappy to hear that Tim isn't seeing Molly any more.
