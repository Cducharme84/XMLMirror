  <Summary>Tim reappears back on Earth for the first time in a while, and is briefly worried about where Molly is, since she didn't appear with him.

However, Molly soon appears next to him, after a much longer absence from Earth.

In the nearby casino, Tala shows up in the hotel room she's been sharing with her current boyfriend Tanarak, after what she assumes was a recent fight with the Phantom Stranger. Tanarak won't talk about it and kicks her out. We see that he is very aged and decrepit.

Tim and Molly are happy to finally be reunited, and kiss. She's too happy to be mad at him for everything that happened. They sneak into the casino for some food.

Tara meets Zatanna, who is doing a show a the casino, to talk about Tanarak. He's trying to kill himself, but she doesn't know why. When they go to Tala and Tanarak's hotel room, Zatana figures it out by the smell of age--Tanarak's immortality is acting like a curse. The is unsuccessfully trying to kill himself because he will live forever in his super-aged body.

Molly and Tim sit down at the casino restaurant and Molly, who has not eaten Earth food in a very long time, orders one of everything. However, when she just drinks a sip of a glass of water, it gags her, and she runs off.

She sees Tanarak shoot himself in the head. She runs up, reminded of her uncle Donal's suicide, but finds out that he's fine. They bond over their misfortune--he over his immortal but decrepit body, her over the fact that since she ate fairy food when she was in faerie, she can't eat Earth food, and can now only float above the ground instead of touching it--a fact that Tim didn't notice. She misses the ability to walk in the grass with bare feet. The mere fact that he didn't makes her feel like he isn't truly paying attention to her. Tanarak, however, does notice.

Zatanna and Tala see Molly and Tanarak, and Tala realizes what has happened to Tanarak. She makes to leave, hating what has happened to him, but Zatanna keeps her from leaving. Tala goes up to talk with Tanarak.

Tim introduces Molly and Zatanna, and the three of them go out to watch the evil immortal couple walk off with their bare feet in the grass.
