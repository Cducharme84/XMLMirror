  <Summary>Tim Hunter visits his imaginary childhood creation, the Wobbly, hoping that it will gobble up all the problems that still plague him. Tim's father returns from the hospital with a newly constructed face. 

Two wood sprites that Tim created during his childhood, Tanger and Crimple, watch the Wobbly acting strange in their abandoned lot.

Tim contemplates at home in a brief period of rest, but things have changed: Sister Staylace, now going by Gwendolyn, is living at his house, helping to take care of Tim while his dad is in the hospital.  He likes the way she treats him as a real person.

The doctors have reconstructed Bill's face after the fire, but he's reluctant to take the bandages off.  He doesn't believe that he's fixed. His main doctor, the mysterious Dr. Vasuki, lets him go home anyway.

Bill procrastinates while walking home.  On the way, an obnoxious child, Cyril, points at him and calls him him the Invisible Man because of his bandages.  His mother, Holly, tries to make up for it by getting Bill a taxi and sharing it with him.

Tim is also nervous about his dad coming home, and having him meet Gwendolyn. Tim got rid of his dad's awful chair, beer and TV, which Bill retreated to to avoid reality. However, the car his mother died in is still outside the house.  After dithering about it, Tim decides to get the Wobbly to get rid of the car, although he's worried about what happens when the Wobbly is loose.

He asks the Wobbly to do it, and he agrees because he collects the useless, and the car is useless. But he won't go back to the yard afterwards.

When Tim gets home, he finds his dad, looking handsome without his bandages.  He has already met Gwen, and likes her; she'll stay.  Tim and his dad talk, and start on the road to forgiveness with each other.

The Wobbly grabs the car and takes it away.
