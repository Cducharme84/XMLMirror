  <Summary>Tim thinks about his mom, and wishes she could tell him how to deal with his present difficulties at school. He puts on the necklace that he found in her grave a couple issues ago. When his dad opens the door, he sees that Tim looks like his mom, Mary--the necklace is a Glamour Stone that made the wearer look like that; his mother was seemingly not really who she seemed to be. Bill does a double take and Tim takes off the necklace before he notices.

Cyril continues to talk with the dead teacher's body that he is secretly hiding in the school's basement. He wants to kill Tim, maybe by poison. He has a new plan to discredit Mr. Currie. He tells the principal the rumor he has already spread among the boys, that Currie is gay and sleeping with Tim. The principal confronts Currie, without being specific about the charge against him.

Some of the other boys threaten to beat up Tim for his perceived homosexuality, but the actually gay Davis saves him by photographing them in the act and blackmailing them. Davis explains that he and the other gay students are all from rich and powerful families whose parents are hiding them away from high society, since Bardsey is a second class school, while the other boys are just middle-class. they know Tim is straight, but like him since the other kids hate him.

Cyril continues to talk about his insane fantasies of being King of the Dead, tipping off Currie and Tim that he is the one behind the rumors about both of them.  Currie contacts Tim and says he is a teacher. Tim isn't interested in being taught, but agrees to work with Currie to find Cyril's "land of the dead."

Tim puts stars on Cyril's shoes, which allows him to track him.  They find the body of the teacher Cyril has been hiding.  They take the body out with the assistance of Davis and his friends, who are happy to be involved in a scheme like this.  They dump it in the Thames, so it looks like he committed suicide.

Currie resigns over the rumors about him and Cyril, but as Tim explains, now Cyril is in trouble with the bullying kids, because they think he agreed to sleep with Currie.

Currie decides that it is time to tell Tim that he is not a Faerie or troll, but from one of the world's that Tim created, and thus one of Tim's own creations.
