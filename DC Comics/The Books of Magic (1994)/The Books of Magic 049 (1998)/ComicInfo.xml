  <Summary>Circe agrees to help Tim in his endeavors. They discuss Molly, whom Circe was trying to help when she gave Tim his tattoos. Tim explains that the tattoos actually drove her away from him, which Circe didn't expect. Tim realizes that Circe is actually a god, which is why she keeps making mistakes while trying to "fix" people--she doesn't truly understand them.

Slaggingham, back at the church, sits and plans a construction to trap the angels and demons.

Tim and Circe find the remains of Awn the Blink, destroyed in the explosion. Tim rebuilds him, without magic.  They task Awn with rebuilding Slaggingham, and then together building Slaggingham's traps. They intend to catch both women--the one with a star halo, who Tim refers to as "Our Lady of Bad Eye Makeup"--and the Queen of Wounds (the nun). He implies that the star-halo lady is responsible for Cyril and turning his dad and Araquel into chocolate, and the Queen of Wounds is responsible for originally turning his dad into a monster.

It somehow seems that the Queens want him to build these traps, but only to catch the other one.

Awn puts Slaggingham's head on the trap, which looks like a globe-shaped ferris wheel with venus flytrap seats.

Circe brings Tim some ice cream, his classic treat to get with Molly. He is surprised there were any shops left, and Circe mentions that it was mysteriously the only building on the block that didn't burn down.

They are about to turn on the machine when some random fighting devils and angels knock over Araquel, smashing his chocolate form.

Angry, Tim turns on the machine, and it sucks in all the angels and demons, including both ladies. We can now see that the nun has white balloons. Slaggingham refers to the ladies as God and the Devil, with the Queen of Wounds possibly being God.

Still angry, Tim throws the ice cream at the nun, who smiles.  Both women's cages open, and a little girl pops out with black and white balloons.  She calls herself Spinning Jemmy, and says she was both women, and was tired of playing with the angels and devils; she had just wanted ice cream.

She floats off, buoyed by both kinds of balloons.

Tim is still angry at the angels and devils. The machine stays in the park, still filled with the creatures. It is unclear whether normal people realize what it is or not.
