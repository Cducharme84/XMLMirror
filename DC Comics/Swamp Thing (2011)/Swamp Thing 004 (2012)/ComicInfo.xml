	<Summary>All across the world, those with a primal connection to the forces of life and death can feel that something is very wrong. The war between The Green andThe Other has begun, and the knights of decay walk the Earth unchecked â€“ but without Alec Holland, the Green has no champion strong enough to fight back!

 

In a small diner in Western Texas, William Arcane walks in and orders a milkshake. When the waiter get the order wrong William kills everyone in the restaurant. Later Abby and Alec arrive to see the horror left in William's wake. They leave the diner and find a spot to sleep. Here Alec has a premonition of something being built by the Rot. He is also contacted by the Parliament of Trees where they try to convince I'm that he needs to embrace and become Swamp Thing.

The Parliament explains that they have always fought the Rot over the entire existence of the Earth. They tell Alec that the Swamp Thing is a warrior, an avatar used to represent the whole of the Green. They also warn him of Abigail and actually insist he kill her. When they awake Abby wants to leave and search for William on her own but Alec insists that he come with her as payment for saving his life.
