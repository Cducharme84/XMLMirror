	<Summary>The Rot is winning, and its necropolis in the American desert is nearly complete. With Abigail Arcane all but lost to its power and the herald of Sethe risen, Alec Holland will bitterly regret trying to flee his destiny as Swamp Thingâ€¦but even if he wanted to do the right thing, it's too late now!

 

Abby and Alec have just finished defeating William's mini army of decay when Alec goes weak. He says that he has lost his connection to the Green; the Parliament is crying out in fear. William is released from his entrapment and he grabs hold of Abby. He begins to wrap Abby in a cocoon when suddenly we see the grove of the Parliament of Trees being burnt to the ground by the man who infiltrated it. William explains that Abby and Alec have both refused their destiny.

William state that Abby is the true avatar for the Rot. Alec tries to free her but he is attacked by bird like creatures. He flees on the motorcycle and Abby is taken away to the Rot's kingdom. Alec returns to the swamp where he begs for the Parliament to transform him again but he arrives to late and the Parliament is too weak to do so. Suddenly Alec is ripped almost in half by a chainsaw. A group of Sethe puppets have set up an ambush and are now attacking Alec.
