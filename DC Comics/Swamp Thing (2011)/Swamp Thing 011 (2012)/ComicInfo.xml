  <Summary>Part two of ANTON ARCANEâ€™S return, as his role in the mythology of THE ROT is revealed! Do NOT miss the final page of this issue!

Following last issue Abigail turns to run from the advancing Arcane and his legion of Un-Men. She fights some off with her shotgun but freezes when Arcane drags in Alec's body. He knocks Abby out and walks her away to the swamp. We are taken into the Green where the Parliament of Trees has saved Alec's consciousness and left his body. He tells the Parliament to wake him up. Back in the swamps Abby has woken up and escapes from Arcane's grip. Arcane grabs at Abby and takes with him a piece of flesh. Alec wakes up and begins to fight Arcane.

Arcane's Un-Men jump Alec but he grows spikes on his body and pierces through all of them. He challenges Arcane and they unleash their powers. Alec punches and slices Arcane but even though he is impressed by his newfound abilities, Arcane starts to gain the upper hand. Suddenly Abigail comes over and shoots him in the head with her shotgun. Arcane manages to escape into a portal into the Rot. Abigail makes a connection and sees into the Rot, she finds horrors and nightmares. When Alec advises that they should leave this portal they are approached by Buddy Baker and his family who tells Swamp Thing and Abby the need to enter together.

*Notes:*
The cover is a homage to the cover of Baffling Mysteries #7.
