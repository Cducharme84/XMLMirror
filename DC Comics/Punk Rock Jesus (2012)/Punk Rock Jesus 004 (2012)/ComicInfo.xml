  <Summary>A devastating loss pushes Chris to the brink. Feeling betrayed and alone, he begins to research the world that Slate and OPHIS have kept him from his entire life. Armed with new knowledge, a new haircut, and a new attitude, an angry Chris is about to tell the whole world the truth. And it all starts after he discovers a few old records in Thomasâ€™s room...

Gwen uses the help of the NAC to try to get Chris out of J2. They infiltrate the studio at night and fight their way to Chris' room. Just before Gwen reaches Chris, the door closes on her, killing her. Thomas beats up Slate, knowing that he manipulated the door intentionally. He is fired.

After Gwen's death Chris educates himself about religion, education, history and punk rock, emancipating himself from the life he had been living in J2 up to that point. He is invited to host the Grammy Awards but his appearance shocks the audience as he dresses himself as a punk rocker with a new haircut. After stating what he thinks of J2 and religion he escapes.

Thomas, with the help of Rebekah, races to find Chris. He reminiscences about his past becoming a killer for the IRA, looking for revenge after an assault in a bar. He becomes a regular killer of RUC people, cutting his hair in the same punk manner and tattooing crosses on his back for each person he killed.

Chris becomes the lead singer of the punk band 'The Flak Jackets'. When he is interviewed by a reporter, he tells America that "Jesus hates you."
