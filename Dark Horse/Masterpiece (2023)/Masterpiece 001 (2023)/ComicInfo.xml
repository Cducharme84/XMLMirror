  <Summary>From the Eisner award-winning creators behind Daredevil and Scarlet comes an all-new crime comic epic!!

Emma is a brilliant and driven 16-year-old. She has paid for school with her next level inventions and is well-known for her funny and honest webcomics. Then, one day, one of the most famous billionaires on the planet confronts her with the truth about her world. Emma discovers she is the only daughter of two of the greatest, most charismatic master criminals of all time. The suavest, most liked criminals ever. The criminal's criminal. The ones that wrote the rulebook. There are movies about them starring the biggest movie stars. Her parents were the authors of the greatest casino robbery of all time, the greatest museum heist of all time, AND they took the world's most famous billionaire for a cool billion... before they disappeared never to be seen or heard from again. Ghosts.

Zero Preston is the greedy billionaire her parents brilliantly ripped off before they disappeared. He has been looking for payback for years. He finds Emma . . . who clearly does not have his money. Zero threatens Masterpiece into pulling a grand, impossible job against his corporate enemy. This "Master of the Universe" will have his satisfaction.

Masterpiece fashions a crew of her peers and her parents' old associates to pull off one of the greatest heists of all time.

Among the cast of characters comes the return of the legendary criminal The Paragon. A Robin Hood for our times. This exquisitely well-dressed, long con master criminal returns to his calling when faced with the truth behind the sinister corporate forces of Zero.
