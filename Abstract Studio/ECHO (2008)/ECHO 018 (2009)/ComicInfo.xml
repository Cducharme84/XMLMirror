  <Summary>Julie Martin channels the other woman living inside her to break into HeNRI's top-secret research facility and steal the rest of the Beta Suit. But what they find is more than they could have imagined - and far more deadly!

In a bar Will's lab assistant Vijay is out with his friends when he gets a text that Will committed suicide. His friend half jokes that he is next as everyone on the Phi project is dying. He goes to the bathroom and Cain enters the bar looking for him. In the toilets Cain kills another man mistaking him for Vijay who escapes.

Ivy chats with Julie and has her tell her everything. Ivy asks her about Annie and has an idea of how to communicate directly with her. She gets behind Julie and starts to strangle her. She says if she is this close if the suit were to attack it would kill them both so if she can get Julie to blackout it should bring Annie out and it appears to start working.

Meanwhile Hong recovers enough to escape his room.</Summary>
