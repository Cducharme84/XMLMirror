Ivy is on the trail and finds Julie's crater and looking from the air gains even more perspective on the happenings her and at Moon Lake.

Dillon requires CPR after his shock from the suit and Julie reveals that she has been speaking with Annie and even taking over her mind at times. Dillon notes theres more metal on her body now too. She confirms the metal moves but also it might have come from Cain

Pam has decided to only pretend to take her medicine and with a clear head sneaks out.

Ivy tracks them down for the first time and has her eyes on them from the sky when she calls them on the phone.</Summary>
