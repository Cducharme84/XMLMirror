  <Summary>*The Past *
In an art class there is a replacement male model for the usual female ones. A young Katchoo's artwork is singled out as getting the idea. The Artist takes her to one side and offers her a sponsorship and a show in Houston. It takes all his persistence to get her to agree.  When she calmly reveals she has an art show at dinner that night Francine's excitement is infections and Katchoo actually gets excited too. As Fran runs around looking for clothes to wear she poses with handfuls of clothes in her hand and underwear. Just as Katchoo complains to David about always having to draw men when she needs a real muse. Francie is very hesitant but the love and importance of it means she agrees to model. * Flash Forward*
A red faced Francie has been crying in her bed again, she comes down to her mother and  Katchoo.</Summary>
