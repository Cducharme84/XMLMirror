  <Series>Terry Moore's Strangers in Paradise</Series>
  <Summary>Katchoo walks into a service station, with a bruised face, and as she picks up goods the clerk watches her intently, much to her disgust, she walks up to a drinks cabinet and kicks in the glass door and trashes the place.                                       It's Francine's birthday and its not going as well as she would like. Her family light heartedly joke about the accident at the play but she is still embarrassed by it. Katina's mother bails her out and the two argue. Her mother refuses to acknowledge that her new husband beat and raped Katina. Katina walks away from her mother and declares she has no home anymore.                                         Fran zips up her jacket and covers herself up as much as possible. On entering class she gets an ovation and chants of  "Toga". Freddie is now suddenly very interested in Fran but she is still preoccupied. She finds a note in her locker saying Katchoo is leaving town tonight and would like to see her before she catches the bus.  In the cold evening air the pair chat slowly. Francine baked Katchoo some cookies for the trip and and laments that she just found her best friend and now she's leaving. But theres nothing she can do.</Summary>
