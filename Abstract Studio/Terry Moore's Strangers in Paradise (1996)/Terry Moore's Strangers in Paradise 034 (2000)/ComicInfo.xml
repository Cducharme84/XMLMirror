  <Summary>Welcome to the fast lane, dear boy, it's New York City, SiP style! David's search for the underground Katchoo leads him to the heart of the powerful and deadly "Big Six" operation in downtown Manhattan, where he attempts to take his inherited seat alongside the leaders. The trouble is, they don't want him... in fact, they'd rather he were dead! Can David stay alive long enough to find his beloved Katchoo? Or perhaps more importantly, will he remain true to his peaceful faith or revert to the ultra-violent ways of his youth in order to survive and protect the woman he loves? The shocking answer is in this issue!</Summary>
