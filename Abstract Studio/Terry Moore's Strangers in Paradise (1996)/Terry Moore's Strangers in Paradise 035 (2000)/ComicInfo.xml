  <Series>Terry Moore's Strangers in Paradise</Series>
  <Summary>The wicked make war and Veronica is as wicked as they come, my friends! Armageddon begins as Veronica's plan to destroy the underworld establishment and create a new "disorder" bears fruit. Sal Tucciani, head of The Big Six and organized crime, declares war on Veronica's clan and Katchoo's small but powerful group, while the two girls are engaged in a deadly game of cat and mouse... the first one to be found dies! Will David be able to do anything to stop the fire of hate that has upset the delicate balance between these dark and complex factions? The solution may be found in Tambi, the cold, calculating killer who is playing everybody against each other in a nerve-wracking game of control, and reveals the shocking reason why in this issue! Meanwhile, back home, Francine prepares for her wedding and agonizes over just how white her dress should be.</Summary>
