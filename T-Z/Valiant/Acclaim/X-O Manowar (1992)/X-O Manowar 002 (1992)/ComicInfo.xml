  <Summary>With his friend and ally, Ken Clarkson, Aric brings his war on the Spider Aliens to the heart of their empire on Earth -- the corporate headquarters of Orb Industries. But Lydia and Spider Aliens have set a trap there for their most savage of foes.

Even as Aric and Ken strive to consolidate their new corporate empire, Toyo Harada dispatches the bionic assassin, Sniper, to slay the armored alien seen recently in New York. When Sniper confronts Aric, Harada realizes that this armored warrior is no alien when he shows concern for the injured bystanders! Ordering Sniper to withdraw, Harada ponders how to deal with this powerful new entity.

- X-O Armor Wolf Class

The issue opens with X-o fighting a spider alien. Afterwards he carries his friend to his home where his doctor roommate stops him from bleeding to death from his severed arm. As they are resting, the house is attacked and Arics friend Eddie ia kidnapped.

He follows his armor to the alien headquarters their he meets and kills what he believes to be the king of the aliens. Only it ends up being a trap set by the queen, yet when she shows her teeth to him, Aric quickly disposes of her.
