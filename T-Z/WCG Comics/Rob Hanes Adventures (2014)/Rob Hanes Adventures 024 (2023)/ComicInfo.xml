  <Summary>Real life and fiction collide when Rob is hired to investigate threats to shut down the production of a new streaming series that also happens to be based on his adventures at Justice International. The kidnapping of one of the show’s stars during an overseas junket leads to on-set intrigue, crooked agents, battling studio heads, creative bookkeeping, and even a Russian oligarch—in other words, another typical day in Hollywood in a tale that could only be called "Tinseltown Confidential!"</Summary>
