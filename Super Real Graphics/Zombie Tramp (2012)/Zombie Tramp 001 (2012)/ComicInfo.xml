  <Summary>Sheeeee'ssssss baaaaaccckkkk!!!

It seems you can't keep Janey Belle down. After her first series turned thousands of fans onto our unique undead gal, we knew her story couldn't be over (She's a zombie! She can't die!!??)... But Janey's creator was ready to draw something else for a while (fairies it seems, but more on that another time). Then we started to see legions of converts to her tales in person at shows, and suddenly, WHAM-O, Dan was ready to draw more zombies!

So, we're back for volume two, and picking up right where we left off. Though, I think you'll see, Dan's got some new things in store for our favorite flesh-gobbling tramp... and I don't just mean her ever-changing fetish fashion! (or hey, take a look, there's even a new color this time!! We spared no expense for this sequel folks!)

 

All aboard!!</Summary>
