  <Summary>Special thanks to Hasbro's Aaron Archer, Michael Kelly, Amie Lozanski, Val Roca, Ed Lane, Michael Provost, Erin Hillman, Jos Huxley, Samantha Lomow, and Michael Verrechia for their invaluable assistance.Revenge of The Decepticons Part 4: Burning Chrome: Prime and his Autobot contingent confront Megatron, who tells Prime that the Autobots he captured have been left in a city to be destroyed by weapons that were once part of his old persona (gun form). Prime then shoots Soundwave to break his control over them, since he knew Megatron couldn't be hurt in his new form and wasn't controlling them. Meanwhile, Spike tries to stop 2 humans from destroying them, and realizes they've been freed from Soundwave, but a police officer on scene thinks about dx'ing the bots, but is hit by Jazz impulsively before anything else happens to them.</Summary>
