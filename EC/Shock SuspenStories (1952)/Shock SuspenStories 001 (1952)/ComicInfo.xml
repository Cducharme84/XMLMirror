  <Summary>The Neat Job!: An abused housewife married to a neat freak snaps one day and neatly dices the sections of her husband's body into small jars.

Yellow!: A Colonel's son faces the firing squad for cowardice under fire, and is court-martialed and found guilty, sentenced to die by firing squad. Later, the Colonel lies to his boy, telling him that the rifles are loaded with blanks so that his son will go to his death like a man.
