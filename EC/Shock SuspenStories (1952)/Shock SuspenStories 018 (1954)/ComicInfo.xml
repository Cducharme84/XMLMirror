The Trap: A husband is betrayed by his wife and funeral director when they plot to commit fraud to collect on his life insurance policy for his own murder. They plan to make him appear to be the victim of a mugging and then disappear in South America for a year.

He chases after him and a city-wide manhunt begins. Soon, McLeod spots a man carrying a bag and shoots and kills him, only to discover that the dead man is not the maniac (who was already captured), but an innocent man carrying a bowling ball!
