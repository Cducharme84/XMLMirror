  <Summary>Raw Deal: Gregg Bolton cannibalizes his new bride in order to survive being stranded at sea.

The Confidant: A stranger comes to town to visit a down on his luck boy named Jimmy. The townspeople warn him that they are on the lookout for someone that killed a 19 year old girl and to be careful. A mob beats to death this stranger, in reality a priest, when the man refuses to betray the confession of the killer.

For Cryin' Out Loud!: Marty, a well-known embezzler on the lam, falls for a beautiful gal and uses a false name when introducing himself. However, he later discovers that she knows who he really is, and when she tells him that she wants $25,000 to keep quiet, he strangles her to death. But his conscience bothers him so much that he has an uncontrollable urge to confess the deed to anyone in earshot.

Well Trained: A detective arrests the burglar who murdered his wife. The detective brutally beats the man, hospitalizes him, and hounds him in the hospital about the death he will receive in the electric chair. The detective fixates on his vengeance to such a degree that the killer flees the hospital and is struck by a subway car. The detective is tortured by the uncertainty of whether the killer was electrocuted by the third rail or if the train struck him first.
