  <Summary>Easel Kill Ya!: The man went to a bridge he intended to jump from to his death at age 29. He was a lonely, unappreciated artist who was going to end it all when a car slammed into a barrier and from the crumpled wreck a woman staggered out. He was inspired to paint the scene, then sold it to a certain gentlemen. This scenario played out again and again as horrible accidents gave him inspiration to paint until he met a girl he was to marry. When she had a horrible accident and needed an operation, the artist killed someone for inspiration to paint the picture to sell, but inadvertently made a horrible mistake.

A Peach of a Plot!: Lieutenant Dolan looked at the roots of a peach tree that held the corpse in its roots, and ordered the corpse and tree be taken in for autopsy. He turned to Michael Lane, the murderer, who now confessed to why he did the act. Her name was Sarah, young, wealthy and beautiful, and he got what he wanted from her until she realized that he didn't love her....just her money. There was a terrible fight, then talk of divorce. Finally one night, as she ate a peach, he killed her, buried her in the garden and destroyed all of her possessions, giving the impression she had left him. The problem was that she has swallowed the peach pit, and from that pit, a peach tree began to grow. Seven years passed by and finally the tree bore fruit.....Lt. Dolan came by the house, hoping to trap Lane into admitting the act he suspected him of. Then as they walked into the garden, Lane reached for a peach and bit into it....quickly spitting it out. The Lieutenant now knew where to look for Lane's wife's body, for that peach had blood inside it!

The Lake: Years ago, a little boy and his young girl friend, Tally played at the beach and built sandcastles together. One day, Tally swam out into the water and drowned, leaving the sandcastle undone, and no closure for the boy. Years later, the little boy, now grown, got married and returned to the beach with his wife, and met with the old lifeguard, who showed him Tally's body in a sack. Once more, the young man returned to the beach, built an entire sandcastle and walked back to his wife, Margaret, leaving the past behind.

One Good Turn...: Jennifer came home in a cheerful mood and went into the bedroom to see her husband, who had been paralyzed in bed for many years. She excitedly told him just how wonderful it felt to actually be needed by other people: people who were unhappy for a variety of reasons, and how she cheered them up by killing them. When the two detectives came to the home to investigate, they found Edwin already dead by cyanide poisioning, and Jennifer happy that she could make him happy as well.
