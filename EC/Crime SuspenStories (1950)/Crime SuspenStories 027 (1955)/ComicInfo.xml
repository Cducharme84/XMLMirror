Ed had been looking for Marty for two years, hoping to exact revenge upon him for taking his girl, Shirley, and money. But Marty tries to convince Marty that the girl and his soon-to-be wife, was no good and it was her idea to take Ed's money. But Ed discovered it was a ruse to await a local trooper that stopped in every night about that time. Unfortunately, as the trooper drove up, a speeding car went by and the cop went after it. As Ed kills Marty, the trooper is talking to the couple in the car: a guy and Shirley, Marty's wife, who was cheating on him.

Jim Ward was a strict father, but a loving one as well toward his son, Paul. But Jim  was concerned with all the trouble his son was continually getting into, and every time the boy offered a male excuse for his behavior. As time went along, Paul because worse and worse, until he murdered a criminal named Evans, who had gotten Paul involved in illegal activities. But a father's love caused Jim Ward to do the unthinkable!</Summary>
