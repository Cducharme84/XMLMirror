  <Summary>It's 2083, and there's not much left of New York City after years of floods, pests, and infrastructure mismanagement. Broadway is a sea of grass that ends at the 59th Street floodwall, and tourists arrive by ferry to take glass-bottom boat tours of downtown and the outer boroughs. The only people keeping the city habitable for its few remaining residents are the pest controllers, and humane laws mean they generally aren't allowed to kill. Felicia Shepherd is a pest controller who has recently taken over the family business after her mother disappeared and a rat-related accident took her dad out of commission. Felicia does the best she can for her clients, but her job becomes much harder when swarms of unnervingly organized pests start running rampant across the city! Enjoy the first issue of this nonstop title, followed by the entire story collected soon after in one volume.
