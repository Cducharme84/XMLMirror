  <Summary>Ernie's rescuers explain their reasons for wanting to serve him. They knows the ends coming so why not do it as Evil's righthand men. He uses his now found power to see into the livings minds to read who they are. He finds them pathetic but starts to kill them one by one all the same.   He raises up 2 of them and after hearing the leaders story he has his form friends tear him to pieces and burns the building down, destroying them all bar one who he releases to wander free by himself. None of them getting what they wanted by reviving Ernie. Living Ernie continues his wandering around the town seeing visions of his past and asking them questions. His undead parents start to kill people in the town and crate a new group of undead to hunt down the living with the living Ernie as a major target to be their first sacrifice.</Summary>
