	<Summary>Created by: acclaimed filmmaker Shekhar Kapur (Elizabeth, Four Feathers, Bandit Queen).

START OF A NEW STORYLINE! It's been a month since Devi disappeared. In hiding, Tara tries hard to understand whether or not she wants to be a goddess or if she has a choice anyway. Meanwhile, Kratha launches a desperate attempt to break Iyam out of Durapasya captivity to help her finish what she started, and another power that seeks to shape the future of the world emerges.

Agantuk goes to the Cabinet of Shadows, a group battling for the right of man to lead their own lives without affect from gods or demons; he is their agent within the Durapasya. He speaks with them about the Devi situation. She has been unseen for a month and Kratha escaped the night after capture.

He is then introduced to another of the Cabinet's agents. One within the Darinde, the followers of Bala: Amara Gaelle. She speaks of her efforts to find the source, a vessel that contains a millennia of unanswered prayers, which would have immeasurable power if unleashed. A plan is concocted to extract it, but Agantuk receives a call that Iyam has escaped.

Elsewhere, Tara awakes in Rahul's apartment and is told that she has spent the last month in the mogue so she would be safe. She has no memory of this, but Rahul says she caused strange things to happen while there. The two are transported to a woman who was praying for help from Devi as she is being attacked. Unable to call on her powers, the Devi entity takes control and dispatches with the men. After which they are transported back to Rahul's apartemnt and Tara is very distraught about her condition, and gets up to leave.
